      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Veythmir is the engine city of the Crowned Kingdoms. Aether rails web the air. Smoke stacks speak in sparks. Rivermen count coin by the barge. Decisions made here push outward along roads and rivers until farm bells ring in places that never voted.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The House of Voices sits in a circular chamber whose seats rise by influence. Nobles, guildmasters, scholars, marshals, and envoys speak in turn while clerks record every word. Votes stall until bargains clear the air. It is not a senate of equals. It is a forum of leverage where a louder purse can move a quiet law buy buying votes. Day to day rule of each kingdom remains within its own confines but the House decides matters that reach across borders. Once the bell rings for a vote, the tally stands, and decrees are measured instantaneoudly</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> The riverfront shines with tile, copper gutters, and lit streets. A short walk away the Undercogs run on sweat and debt. Work crews pull twelve hour shifts in the Crucible and sleep in rooms that share a single window. Rail clerks dine above the docks and trade rumors about new engine patents, and dreams for longer voyages. The city believes in progress and pretends progress believes in everyone. It does not. People still climb and many were not destined as such.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> The Spires of Aether refine crystals and anchor engines that power the small number of rail lines and the flurry of workshops. The  Crucible pours steel, extrudes pipe, and cooks varnish for coil windings, the machinations of this new industrious era and while Veythmir builds airship parts when funding allows... airship yards continue to open and close with each batch of skirmishes in the wider world. Still...the city insists that a better hull is only one design away and Engineers mark their jackets with  the toils of persuit.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Cinderhall Cathedral keeps the rite that says office must carry its own cost first. Petitions of mercy are heard at dusk but at dawn the same hall brutally records fines and seizes goods. Worship is not loud here... it is counted. Other shrines sit in side streets, small tokens to a plethora of gods and where candles gutter fast in the draft of pragmaticism.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> The Undercogs run beneath the markets and courts. Cartels move illicit items, street stimulants, and contraband magitech as well as information on all the above and more. There are many powers at play here.... Bushido is one of the quiet names that keeps appearing on lips that no one is really meant to speak. Weapons of an arcane derivation, illegally sourced crystals and various remedies to poverty pass through hands that never touch in public settings. Some votes in the House of Voices fall a half step too neatly when Bushido or other cartels are near.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The city wages brief wars with Ashkarra when corsairs take too much, still unsure quite how to handle the politics and finding no purchase. It buys desert goods from Skathra when the price is kind, or the need is a must. It pretends the Night Baronies do not exist and still buys velvet and ink that came by that road coupled with stories and rumors and and sentences for high crimes both just and perhaps undeserving send people to the Sable Fens to distill the flux that keeps the city wheels turning. Veythmir does not look at what happens to the south after the wagons leave the front gate.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Spires of Aether</em> The Arcanum here teaches engine law and crystal craft to those prospective engineers who show an aptitude and a willingness to learn. Failures are cataloged in a lower vault or pried apart and sold scrap to those who would find use for them. Students are often encouraged to visit this vault before important  tests to remember the price that dilligence and patience saves.</li>
          <li><em>The Crucible</em> Smelters run day and night to continue the evolution of industry within the city, everything everywhere subsequently tastes  at least faintly like iron and smoke. </li>
          <li><em>Highwater Passages</em> Tariff masters decide what a river is worth on any given day and old maps hang on the walls to remind advocates that shorelines often move as frequently as the levies.</li>
          <li><em>Cinderhall Cathedral</em> The rite of burden marks every new office with ash on the brow and a shackle on the wrist, the  physical manifestation of serving the role. The chain is worn under a sleeve afterward and people use it as a method of  accreditation when they listen to a speech or seek answers.</li>
          <li><em>Undercogs</em> Tunnel markets sell coil scrap, off book tools, and food that never cools. Guides paint their knuckles with salt so the rats will not bite when the lamps go out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> Speaker Maeren Vale keeps a calm ledger and a short memory. Guildmistress Sere Caldrin can find coin for any project if the sponsors accept that repayment does not always mean coin. Arbiter Joth Ansel writes rulings that other arbiters quote when they want to sound fair and final.</p>
        <p><strong>Air and river</strong> Airships are rare and dear adn while the yards can fit a hull, a gas frame, or a rig, the envelopes and engines come slow. Pilots who fly these craft become names that the locals remember. Barges on the river are more common and more honest a more longstanding and traditional method of brining grain, timber, vellum, ore, and the small goods that cities require between the span of wars... to the city.</p>

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>Ashkarra</strong> is the rebel canyon city of the Eastern Highlands. It broke from the Crowned Kingdoms and has never returned. Bridges span red cliffs, chain-oaths seal contracts in the Court, and sky corsairs dock their patched rigs along the canyon wall. What began as a corsair camp has hardened into a city with its own law: swift, transactional, and merciless to outsiders.</p>

      <li><strong>Chain Court</strong> the ruling hall where contracts are chained and judgments weighed. Oaths spoken here bind as tightly as iron.</li>
      <li><strong>Marketside</strong> planked bridges hung with awnings and ropes; coil-cores, powder, salt meat, and forged writs all sold openly.</li>
      <li><strong>Red Anchor</strong> drydock ledges where span-runners and rivet-sloops are patched with wire, resin, and whatever canvas still holds air.</li>

      <li><strong>Windstairs</strong> cliffside inns and crew houses. Fights end at the bell or when Idra’s wardens cut the lines to scatter combatants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Current Affairs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The Chain Court has rejected Crown tariffs, declaring all seizures “beyond sight of land” exempt. Osk enforces his own levy instead.</li>
      <li>Karst and two other captains signed no-raid compacts with the Veythmir River Guild, turning corsair raids into contracted escorts.</li>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Ashkarra thrives on contradiction: rebel city and trade hub, pirate port and contract court. Here theft becomes tariff, raids become escort, and outlaw becomes magistrate — provided the chain is pledged and the contract sealed.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The Chain Court does not debate; it tallies. Chains pledged and coin posted matter more than words. Verdicts are measured by weight, not rhetoric, and an empty chest shortens any captain’s defense.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Captains and brokers live above on the high spans, dealing in contracts and coin. Crew gangs rattle in deck houses with hammocks stacked three high. Outsiders are charged at both ends of the bridge — once to enter, again to leave.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Air-rig repair and contraband brokerage dominate the spans. Canyon seams provide ore, while smuggled coil-cores vanish into Ashkarra whenever Veythmir audits too hard.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> No temple stands here. Oaths sworn in the Court bind tighter than prayer. Crews carry broken links of chain as tokens of debt and verdict.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> The underworld is the city itself. Brokers like Hesh Vale thrive in the open, weighing debts at half their worth and selling the remainder twice over.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir denounces corsairs yet hires them as escorts. The Night Baronies pay in velvet and wax, sending letters that smell of blood. Polar wardens demand fees and leave cheated for their trouble.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Chain Court</em> Osk keeps ledgers chained to the benches; verdicts ring out by striking links like a bell.</li>
          <li><em>Span Market</em> Guild scribes tally every contract aloud; thieves wait until the ink dries.</li>
          <li><em>Red Anchor</em> Karst’s runner is docked here, hull shortened and keel reinforced for canyon speed.</li>
          <li><em>Sootdeck</em> Black smoke fouls every mouth; apprentices lose their hair by twenty.</li>
          <li><em>Windstairs</em> Idra’s wardens carry hooks, not swords, ending fights by cutting lines instead of throats.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Ral Osk</em> tallies chains faster than most men speak. <em>Naem Karst</em> flies a span-runner stripped for speed. <em>Hesh Vale</em> can turn any debt into profit twice over. <em>Idra Senn</em> knows every knot that holds the city together and keeps them tied at her word.</p>
        <p><strong>Air and trade</strong> <em>Span-runners</em> are fast, light rigs suited to canyon winds. <em>Rivet-sloops</em> are heavy, stubborn frames built for storms. Both crowd the docks of Red Anchor, patched more with history than cloth.</p>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Mawrange is a wall as much as a homeland. Its passes are few, its law is fewer: oath, guest-right, and the Emberwalk rite. To live here is to live by the word you can prove and the witness who heard it.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Each stonehold rules its terraces, but the Horned Table binds them together. Seats carved from horn and bone remind all that law began in pact with dragons. Disputes are weighed by witnesses and settled with chains of coin or blood.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Highlords carve halls into mountains; farmers build terraces that outlive their names. Pilgrims climb the Ember Path each spring, carrying coals in bowls, proof that endurance is truth. Honor here is not a notion but a ledger recited at feasts.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Ore, blackstone, and crystal flow from the peaks. Forged horns and carved bone are common trade. Terrace barley and goat herds keep the ridgefolk alive, while caravans bring what the heights cannot grow.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Emberwalk rite is both pilgrimage and trial. To reach the high shrine with ember still lit is proof of oath-keeping. Those whose coals die are marked as oath-broken and live with that brand forever.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers move stolen crystals through Ashkarra. When caught, the punishment is public: the stone shattered, the smuggler’s name struck from clan rolls. Bandits rarely last a season; the peaks bury them faster than justice.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir covets the ore but mistrusts oath-law. Ashkarra trades crystal for steel and pays twice what it should. The Baronies send letters sealed in wax that melt before they reach the heights.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Kaelthwyn stands as both fortress and scripture. Its terraces are records of lives, its halls are ledgers of oaths. To step inside is to be weighed by memory as much as by law.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Highlord Varros presides, advised by scribes and matrons. Every law is carved into slate and sung aloud by chorus. Disputes are judged in the Hall and echo across the range once spoken three times.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Carvers carry more respect than coiners; to inscribe an oath is considered higher craft than to forge a blade. Terrace farmers and goat herders live knowing their work will outlast their names. Pilgrims are judged by how clearly they repeat the laws given to them at the gate.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Stone, iron, and crystal are Kaelthwyn’s exports. The Oathmarket guarantees goods by sworn word — if a tool breaks before its time, the seller stands in court to answer.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Emberwalk begins here. Pilgrims carry a coal from Kaelthwyn’s forge; if it still burns when they reach the high shrine, they are counted oath-true. If it dies, they live oath-broken.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers etch false clan runes into crystal and move them through Ashkarra. Punishment is severe: the false stones are shattered in public, and the smuggler’s name struck from all records.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Kaelthwyn bargains with Veythmir for tools and grain, but mistrusts its coin-law. Ashkarra buys stolen stone readily. The Baronies send no emissaries — letters arrive, but no lord admits to opening them.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>High Terrace Hall</em> Verdicts are binding only when read by three voices: lord, scribe, and witness.</li>
          <li><em>Carvers’ Ledge</em> Apprentices carve their first oath chain with bare hands; the links are worn at their belts until death.</li>
          <li><em>Oathmarket</em> Traders wear chains openly; the heavier the chain, the stronger the reputation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Cael Varros</em> remembers every oath sworn to him across decades. <em>Elira Vey</em> oversees the Emberwalk with stern patience. <em>Joth Korr</em> has transcribed every law for thirty years without fault. <em>Bren Arthis</em> commands wardens who guard the caravan stairs in and out of the hold.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Salt’s Rest is not just a waystation — it is the only anchor in the Blind Wastes that lasts. Fort walls enclose wells sunk deep into the rock. Caravans gather here in their hundreds before braving glass plains and flux storms. To leave Salt’s Rest without the right contracts is suicide.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The Syndic Hall is ruled by a council of syndicates. Each syndicate maintains its own guards and caravans. Dreel acts as primus among them, but his power rests on fragile agreements and bribes.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Caravan-masters sit in shaded courts while their laborers sleep in the Dust Quarter. Guards are valued as much for loyalty as for blade skill. Outsiders are tolerated as long as they pay, but water is never shared without contract.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Salt is cut into bricks, water is rationed, and caravan contracts drive the fort’s economy. Relics from the desert sometimes surface in the Outer Bazaar, sold to whoever pays most, often emissaries of the Baronies or Crowned Kingdoms.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Prophetess Mirae and her followers tie glass shards to the well ropes as offerings. The Syndics despise the practice but cannot ban it without riots. Pilgrims from across the Wastes come to hear her visions.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Raiders sell stolen goods to corrupt guards at night. Syndics quietly buy them to resell under legitimate contracts. Everyone knows — but no one dares close the gates. Survival depends on trade, even when poisoned.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The Crowned Kingdoms want a permanent garrison here, but no syndic will surrender autonomy. Ashkarra captains run water-smuggling contracts in exchange for protection. The Baronies fund relic seekers, turning Salt’s Rest into a clearing house of stolen history.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Syndic Hall</em> Every contract is sealed in salt and blood, pressed into wax with caravan crests.</li>
          <li><em>Caravan Yard</em> The cries of camels and clatter of chains drown every negotiation.</li>
          <li><em>Salt Pools</em> Each brick is stamped with a crest; counterfeiting is punished by exile into the desert without water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Armun Dreel</em> holds power by balancing syndicate rivalries. <em>Zahir al-Keth</em> leads the largest caravan line, claiming routes others fear. <em>Mirae of the Shard</em> preaches visions that split the fort between faith and disbelief.</p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Greyspire is a ledger of blood. Its halls echo with centuries of debts, oaths, and betrayals. Each new baron adds stone to the ruin, and each old baron is remembered only in ledgers and feasts.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The baronial moot holds no king, only shifting alliances. Votes are weighed by tithe, not by loyalty. The Speaker of Hospitality presides at feasts, ensuring that blood debts are postponed until the final cup is drained.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Lords drink from chalices of ash, servants wear chains of silver, and vassals live by the breath of their patrons. To be invited into the Guest Tower is honor and threat alike.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> The Baronies produce velvet, ink, and wine, all traded through Greyspire. The tithe system drains peasants to fill Blood Vaults, but trade keeps the spire alight with torches and luxuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Feasts begin with the Law of Hospitality recited aloud: “Guests are safe until dawn.” To break this is death — not only in flesh, but in name. Priests are rarely seen; the barons make their own sacraments in blood and ash.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Greyspire has no hidden underworld — it is openly corrupt. Duels, poisonings, and debts are arranged in daylight, justified by law after the fact. Smugglers thrive only if they bribe three barons at once.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir trades velvet and ink despite denouncing the barons. Ashkarra sells them contraband and corsair spoils. The Mawrange ignores them, save when emissaries seek relics in the mountains.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>The Spire Hall</em> Barons sit by age of their bloodline, not their size of domain.</li>

        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Baron Caldrex</em> is feared for his debts as much as his sword. <em>Baroness Myre</em> courts foreign emissaries, hoping to tilt the moot in her favor. <em>The Speaker of Hospitality</em> has no name remembered — the role outlives the man or woman who holds it.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Rumia was founded as a retreat from progress. Its founders swore to guard memory untainted by engines, industry, or politics. Here, every word is deliberate, every silence binding. Outsiders find its pace unbearable; locals consider it survival.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The council of Rumia meets in the Quiet Hall. Decisions are made by consensus, not by vote. Each scholar is equal at the table, though elders are listened to longest.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Silence is a form of respect. Visitors are expected to speak only when granted the floor. Knowledge is traded as currency, with copied texts, genealogies, and songs more valuable than coin.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> There is no industry. The enclave sustains itself with farming, foraging, and barter with nearby villages. Its only export is knowledge, reluctantly shared.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Lantern rites mark vows of silence. When a scholar dies, their books are placed in the Lantern Grove and burned to release their words to the air. Faith is plural, but silence is sacred.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers sometimes infiltrate to steal texts. The punishment is exile, branded as “memory thief.” Some return in disguise, others never leave the Wastes alive.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir presses for access to records, seeking legal precedent and ancient patents. Ashkarra pays smugglers for stolen works. Alithanthian pact-holds respect Rumia’s silence, sending envoys only when vital.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Vyranithar was a thriving capital, known for bells that rang each dawn and dusk. Its fall was not a siege, not a famine, not a plague. It simply ceased to be inhabited in a single day. The absence is its legacy.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The Silent Council once presided here, scribes and lords tallying taxes and law. No records describe their final act. The ledgers simply end mid-sentence.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Merchants, priests, and scribes filled the city once. They left no sign of panic, no trail of exodus, no bodies. Only order without people. Scholars call it “the clean absence.”</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Before the fall, Vyranithar exported ink, vellum, and crafted bells. The workshops stand intact, tools laid out as if their masters had just stepped away.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Ashen Cloisters kept rites of silence and burden. Pilgrims now come to walk those cloisters, though many leave unable to speak for days.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Contraband relics are scavenged from the ruins — bells that toll without rope, books that resist reading. Ashkarra brokers sell them at great risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir claims the city as lost territory but dares not garrison it. The Baronies weave it into their myths. Alithanthia avoids it, saying the silence is contagious.</p>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Aurora Spire predates every known culture. It is not quarried stone but a single pillar, smooth and seamless, thrust from the ice. The aurora crowns it eternally, and many claim it sings when the lights shift.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The Auric Wardens keep vigil at the Spire. They permit pilgrimage, forbid excavation, and enforce the law that no tool may strike the stone. Their authority is unquestioned in the north, but elsewhere many call them zealots.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Pilgrims arrive from every corner of the realm, bearing offerings or oaths. Wardens live austere lives in tents, never leaving the plateau. Scholars record but cannot touch. Ascetics stay for decades, eating only snow and fish from the ice rivers.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> None. The Spire produces nothing, consumes everything. Supply caravans bring food, fuel, and ink. In return, they take away nothing but stories and frostbite.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Vigil is the central rite. Pilgrims stand unmoving beneath the lights until dawn. Some return speaking visions; others never rise. The Wardens mark their cairns with black stone chips taken from the ice around the Spire, never from the Spire itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers sometimes sell false “spire shards,” black glass forged in Ashkarra. True shards cannot exist — no tool can cut the Spire, or so the Wardens claim.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir’s scholars clash with Warden prohibitions. Ashkarra captains profit by ferrying reckless pilgrims north. The Night Baronies whisper that the Spire is a doorway they once stepped through and dare not again.</p>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Myrrha’s Cave is less a city than a living record. Each clan traces its survival to the cave mouth, where ancestors sheltered from the storms. To this day, hunters dedicate their kills to those who came before, believing their spirits guide the living hand.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Elders meet in Ancestor Hall, decisions made by reciting names and weighing the length of each line. The longer the lineage, the greater the weight of voice. Disputes are ended by consensus or by hunt — the side that brings back more meat holds the right.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Every child memorizes their lineage. Forgetting a name is treated as shame, remembered in whispers. Hunters hold highest honor; storytellers guard memory. Outsiders are tolerated only if they swear to add their dead to the cave walls.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> None beyond survival. Hunting, gathering, and trade in pelts and bone tools sustain the clans. Outsiders sometimes bring steel, which is valued but distrusted.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Bone Gallery is sacred — bones placed here are considered part of the clan’s eternal watch. Fire rites are common: smoke rises with names recited, sending them skyward to join the aurora lights.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Few secrets exist here, but theft of lineage — erasing or altering a name on the wall — is the gravest crime, punished by exile into the storm.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Aurora Spire pilgrims sometimes rest here, tolerated but kept separate. Veythmir scholars dismiss the rites as superstition, though they covet the cave paintings as records older than any archive. The Night Baronies whisper that they once took names here and lost them.</p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Alithanthia is less a state than a covenant. It survives through balance between mortals and the fey powers that claim its forests. Its laws are written in pacts, signed in blood or ash, and maintained by generations of notaries and wardens.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Authority rests with pact-notaries who interpret and enforce ancient compacts. No king rules; elders convene only to confirm that oaths are maintained. The Silent Court, a fae tribunal, holds influence whenever crossings open near its domains.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Knowledge of oaths and names is currency here. Farmers work clearings carved generations ago, scholars guard records of compacts, and hermits retreat into glades to live under older laws. Class is determined by how well one keeps their word, not how much coin they hold.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Timber is cut sparingly, stone quarried with care. The realm trades in ink, vellum, and pact-writs — documents sealed with authority that other lands respect. Any attempt to over-harvest ends in disaster, blamed on broken oaths.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Worship is directed toward spirits of forest, river, and glade. Oaths sworn at warden circles are treated as binding as divine vows. Candles gutter quickly here, said to be the fey’s way of showing disapproval.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Pact-breakers flee into the Deep Glades, where some vanish, others return twisted. Smugglers sometimes trade forbidden relics from fae realms, but risk exile or worse if caught.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Alithanthia keeps uneasy ties with Veythmir, trading knowledge and resources for industry it does not want to embrace. Ashkarra corsairs sell contraband ink and vellum. The Night Baronies covet Alithanthian paper for their endless treaties, but are rarely welcomed.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Elessus</em> Pact laws are sung as well as written; notaries carry chains of quills to show their rank.</li>

        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Alwen Dreth</em>, chief notary of Elessus, records every compact with ink made from oak gall and blood. <em>Seris Hal</em>, a warden captain, patrols crossings that shift with each moon. <em>The Elder of the Silent Court</em> speaks rarely, but when he does, Alithanthia listens.</p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Crowned Kingdoms are the core of trade and law. Their fields feed armies, their rivers carry goods, and their decrees echo across borders. Yet unity here is brittle — crowns agree only as long as coin and leverage demand it.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> The House of Voices is the central forum. Nobles, guildmasters, and envoys speak in turn, but influence rises with wealth. Votes are traded, bargains struck, and decrees carry force once the bell rings. Crowns retain autonomy within their borders but bend to union law on matters that cross them.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Farmers and craftsmen make up the bulk, feeding cities and armies. Merchants and guilds thrive in urban centers, while nobles measure influence in seats at the House of Voices. Smugglers and cartels exploit the gaps, ensuring every law has a loophole.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Grain, timber, vellum, and ore from the marches support foundries, workshops, and airship yards. Flux from colonies like the Sable Fens powers engines. The Kingdoms’ output feeds wars far beyond their borders.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Shrines to a dozen gods dot the villages, but the greatest rite is civic — the opening of the House of Voices each season, marked by bells across the capital. Faith is practical, tied to harvests and law.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Cartels like Bushido operate in the Undercogs and border towns, buying votes through bribes and intimidation. Smugglers move contraband flux and crystal through rivers, bypassing tariffs and feeding outlaw markets in Ashkarra.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The Kingdoms feud with Ashkarra’s rebels, buy desert goods from Skathra, and send criminals to the Fens. They pretend the Night Baronies do not exist, though velvet and ink still arrive from that quarter. Relations are pragmatic, often hypocritical.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Veythmir</em> Decrees here ripple outward along rails and rivers until bells ring in villages that never voted.</li>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Black Ruin is a living memory of disaster: an endless wall of black ice advancing slowly south since the First Age. It does not melt, it does not stop. Cities once proud now appear as shadows and silhouettes entombed within its face.</p>
        <p><strong>Nature</strong> No one knows if it is natural or summoned. Some claim it is a spell gone wrong, a ward that froze itself eternal. Others say it is the corpse of a god, ground to ice.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture</strong> Villages at its edge treat it like weather — inevitable, deadly, and not to be questioned. Songs warn children not to play near the “whispering ice.”</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Relic hunters pry frozen artifacts, but most come away with nothing but frostbite and silence. What they bring south fetches high coin, though it corrupts quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Some cults worship the wall as the grave of the world’s first age. Pilgrims press ears to it, claiming to hear bells of buried cities.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The Crowned Kingdoms fear its advance toward farmland. Greyspire feasts on its legend. Ashkarra captains sell shards at high risk. Alithanthia refuses to speak of it at all.</p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Night Baronies are built on law as brittle as glass: hospitality is inviolable, but only until dawn. Guests are safe in feast halls; outside them, law is fanged and swift. The baronies endure through ritual, blood tithe, and endless feasts where debts are recited like prayers.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Each barony is its own domain, but Greyspire serves as the moot seat. Votes are weighed by tithe, not loyalty. The Speaker of Hospitality presides over feasts, ensuring tradition is observed even as knives are sharpened.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Nobles dine on velvet and blood, servants wear chains of silver, peasants pay in grain and flesh. Class is absolute: to be born a peasant is to serve until drained. Yet every guest is honored while the feast lasts — hospitality is the only law respected without question.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> The Baronies produce velvet, wine, and ink, much of it traded illicitly to Veythmir. Their true wealth is tithe: a system of blood, grain, and coin demanded in equal measure.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The feast is the ritual, the Law of Hospitality the only scripture. Priests are rare; the barons themselves officiate rites of blood and ash. Guests who survive a feast may consider themselves blessed.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> There is no shadow here — corruption is daylight. Feuds, poisonings, and betrayals are settled openly and justified after the fact by law twisted to fit.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Veythmir trades with the Baronies while pretending not to. Ashkarra captains sell them contraband flux and goods. The Mawrange ignores them, except when emissaries arrive seeking relics in the peaks. The Baronies themselves meddle everywhere, sending letters sealed in velvet wax that smell faintly of iron.</p>

        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Baron Caldrex</em> is feared for demanding debts no one can repay. <em>Baroness Myre</em> courts foreign alliances to tilt the moot. <em>The Speaker of Hospitality</em> is faceless — the role shifts, but the voice of the law never falters.</p>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Polar North is less a region than a crucible. Few survive without oaths to wardens or clans. Light dances above, storms sweep below, and the land itself rewrites its paths each season. Those who return speak of silence deeper than any cathedral, broken only by the crack of ice.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> There is no kingdom, only oaths. The Auric Wardens enforce ancient prohibitions around Aurora Spire. Clan-chiefs rule their hunting grounds by pact, not by law. Authority here is measured by survival, not decree.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Wardens live austere lives guarding the Spire. Pilgrims come from every land, seeking visions. Hunters trade in hides and oil, while ascetics give up all ties to map lights that shift faster than their ink can dry. Outsiders rarely last a season without binding themselves to a host clan.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> None traditional. Trade is blubber, bone, and hides... fuel and survival. Scholars bring coin but little else. Caravans from the south supply the rest, and few dare the return journey twice.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Vigil is the greatest rite. Pilgrims stand beneath the aurora until dawn. Some collapse and die in the snow, others return with visions that alter their lives forever. Wardens mark the cairns of the fallen with black stone.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers sell false shards of the Spire, black glass forged in Ashkarra. True shards cannot exist... the stone cannot be cut. Still, markets in the south pay dearly for them.</p>

        <p><strong>The Ashkarra Highlands</strong> are a scar of redstone canyons and outlaw strongholds. Once taxed by the Crowned Kingdoms, they rebelled, broke their chains, and never returned. Corsair captains rule from sky-rigs, raider clans carve ports into canyon walls, and every oath is written in iron or blood. To travel here is to gamble your coin, your cargo, and your life... the Highlands recognize no authority but force and bargain.</p>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Highlands are not governed... they are endured. Outlaw bands carved cities into canyon walls, sky-corsairs turned raids into escort contracts, and the House of Voices lost control the day its tax chains were broken. No one voice commands here; every oath is temporary, every alliance is fragile.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> There is none in the Crown’s sense. The Chain Court exists in Ashkarra City, where contracts are chained and witnessed. But once the chains are struck, enforcement is left to whoever can swing the heavier crew. Captains rule rigs, clans rule plateaus, brokers rule ledgers.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Status is measured by what you can hold... a rig, a span, a market. Captains dine on plunder, crews fight over hammocks and coin, clans wander red plateaus with stolen herds. Outsiders are prey unless they come with tribute or guns.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> The Highlands produce little, steal much. Ore from canyon seams, stolen flux cores, and smuggled relics flow through their markets. Repair yards patch sky-rigs endlessly, while raider ports unload goods lifted from Crowned caravans.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The only rite is the chain oath: link, seal, and witness. Feasts end when the chain is struck against the table. Superstition lingers in cliff shrines, where captains pour blood into cracks to buy luck in storm winds.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> The Highlands are the underworld of the continent. Every smuggling route leads here eventually. Brokers like Hesh Vale thrive on turning debts into doubled profit. Captains sell silence as often as steel.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The Crowned Kingdoms call Ashkarra rebels but still pay them for escort contracts. The Night Baronies buy smuggled flux and wine. Alithanthia distrusts them, but sometimes sends envoys for stolen records. The Highlands themselves owe nothing to anyone.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Ashkarra City</em> The Chain Court tallies oaths, but its judgments end at the canyon walls.</li>
          <li><em>Corsair Canyons</em> Rigs dock under nets of camouflage cloth, invisible until you are already beneath their guns.</li>
          <li><em>Bone Markets</em> Chains hang above stalls as trophies of broken contracts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Naem Karst</em>, corsair captain, flies a span-runner reinforced for storm runs. <em>Hesh Vale</em>, broker, sells debts like cargo. <em>Kaelen Dorr</em>, matriarch of a canyon clan, rules more by knives than words. <em>Ral Osk</em>, magistrate of the Chain Court, tallies contracts but never enforces them.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nullglass Flats</strong> panes of fused sand that blind the unmasked. Sound carries for miles.</li>
      <li><strong>Brim Vents</strong> sulphur chimneys that sour air and pit metal. Camps shift when the wind turns.</li>

        <p><strong>People</strong> Skathrans trade in scrap and invention. The Mirage refuse walls and keep history in song. Tharukim rule a city that most will never see.</p>
        <p><strong>Rule</strong> No crown binds the desert. Salt’s Rest holds a council of syndics. Skathra is clan held. Tharuk has a court that writes no letters to the surface.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Salt cut into bricks, salvage refit into tools, nullglass shards taken by moonlight. Caravans hire escorts and pay for routes that change after every storm.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Prophets carve omens into salt pillars. Water is blessed at dawn. The Mirage sing star paths and trade verses at crossings.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Tribute to Tharuk moves in sealed crates. Some open them. Those crews are not seen again.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Crowns want contracts that fix prices. Ashkarra sells steel and takes a cut. Baronies fund relic buyers who do not ask where a thing was found.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Sable Fens turns bodies into fuel. Peat is cut, boiled to flux, and sealed in drums marked with the Crown. The work never ends, the marsh never forgives, and the smoke carries to villages that pretend not to smell it.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Overseer Brack Ilen rules by gauge and lash. Factors handle contracts; marsh guards enforce quotas. Appeals go to Veythmir and return months later, usually with more numbers and fewer words.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Free workers wear oilskin hoods and look down when counting chains. Sentenced labor sleep to the bell and wake to the bell. Favors are a parallel currency; a dry pair of boots is worth a week’s pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Flux, tar, and timber. Anything else is contraband and moves at night across the planks.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Chaplain of Burden marks each new arrival with ash and a shackle, “so office carries its own cost.” Prayers are short; the marsh eats the long ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers skim drums and top them with swamp water. Guards take a cut. When Veythmir audits, bodies wash up in the reeds.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The House of Voices denies the Fens are a prison and calls them “labor colonies.” Ashkarra captains sell protection then look away. The Baronies buy flux with velvet and silence.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Boilfields</em> Iron sweats black; crews tie rags over their mouths until they forget what food tastes like.</li>
          <li><em>Gauge House</em> Each missed quota rings once. Three rings means the lash. Five means the ferry steps at night.</li>
          <li><em>Ferry Steps</em> Drums are weighed twice; Jore’s thumb is famous and never caught.</li>

        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Ilen</em> trusts bells more than men. <em>Nella Soot</em> turns shortages into profit on paper. <em>The Chaplain</em> records names, not sins. <em>Jore</em> knows every eddy that hides a drum.</p>

        <p><strong>Government</strong> No crown. The Clanmoot meets on the High Gantry—whoever brings the largest salvage gets the loudest voice. Disputes are settled by weight, not words.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Black Ruin is a wound in stone. No one agrees which feud lit it, only that the heat was not made by forge or sun. The baronies treat it as a shrine to caution and a stage for spectacle.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> None that holds. Lords contest it, servants keep it barely alive, Greyspire tallies the arguments and drinks the wine.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Duels at dawn in the Ash Galleries draw crowds. Villagers trade tales for safety. Travelers avoid the steps after rain.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Scavenged iron, illegal relics, and rumor. The Ruin’s true export is story.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Oaths sworn in the Cindered Chapel bind hard; even barons keep those words.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Poison sellers work the crowds during duel feasts; bodies roll into the breach with the applause.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Greyspire profits from the contest, Veythmir scholars ask the wrong questions, and Ashkarra fences what falls off wagons.</p>
        <p><strong>District detail</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Cindered Chapel</em> Candles gutter fast; melted wax looks like frost.</li>
          <li><em>Fallen Curtain</em> On cold nights, glass in the breach rings like a bell.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Varek Cayne</em> prefers spectacle to stewardship. <em>Lady Mirelle</em> claims the glass answers her touch. <em>Thorn</em> keeps keys that open nothing and still warns visitors not to try them.</p>

<!-- SEVEN CROWNS WAR -->

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>The Seven Crowns War</strong> tore through the heartlands in the late Third Century AE. Ledger kings rose and fell, armies marched by tally rather than loyalty, and when the smoke cleared, the House of Voices claimed authority to bind the crowns together. Laws endured, thrones did not.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conflicting tithe ledgers between seven crowns, each claiming precedence.</li>
      <li>Trade routes taxed twice, starving cities and filling war chests.</li>
      <li>Guilds pushed for centralized arbitration to stop ruinous tariffs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Events</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Armies marched under banners marked with coin tallies instead of heraldry.</li>
      <li>Three crowns fell in a single winter after famine emptied their storehouses.</li>
      <li>The House of Voices was founded mid-war to record treaties; its ledgers outlasted the combatants.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Aftermath</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The war ended not with a battle, but with a ledger: all crowns bound to union law once the bell rang in Veythmir.</li>
      <li>Guilds gained permanent seats in governance; nobles never fully recovered their autonomy.</li>
      <li>The phrase “laws endure, kings do not” entered common speech.</li>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Overview</strong> The Seven Crowns War was a conflict of ink as much as steel. Armies moved by accounts, alliances formed by ledgers, and the House of Voices rose as the only body all sides trusted to keep score.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture</strong> Villages still toll bells to remember the passing of tithes. Songs mock “ledger kings” who marched with more scribes than soldiers.</p>
        <p><strong>Legacy</strong> The House of Voices became permanent. Crowns still argue, but none dare claim independence outside its bell.</p>

        <p><strong>The Ashkarra Secession</strong> marked the Highlands’ break from the Crowned Kingdoms. Tax chains cracked, rebel captains swore oaths in iron, and the Chain Court replaced the Crown’s tariffs. From then on, Ashkarra answered to no law but its own bargains.</p>

        <p><strong>The Flux Beds</strong> marks the Crowned Kingdoms’ decision to industrialize punishment.

      <li>Post-war engine demand outpaced legal flux supply.</li>
      <li>The House of Voices chose “labor colonies” over new taxes.</li>

        <p><strong>The Silent Fall of Vyranithar</strong> ended a capital in a single day. Bells stopped mid-stroke, meals cooled on tables, and the city turned to empty rooms and perfect order. No siege, no plague, no smoke—only absence that breathed.</p>

        <p><strong>Culture</strong> Travelers tie small bells to their gear before entering. If they ring on their own, they leave.</p>
        <p><strong>Legacy</strong> “Clean absence” is now a legal phrase—used when the law can prove nothing but refuses to say nothing happened.</p>
