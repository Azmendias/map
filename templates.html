        <p><strong>Veythmir</strong> is the industrial heart of the Crowned Kingdoms. Founded in 264 AE, the city rose on furnaces, canals, and ledgers. The Crucible of Iron and Aether hums day and night, casting engines and rune-cores. Skyships once clawed the clouds here, and rune-cannons promised a new age of war. Today smoke drifts over iron bridges while the House of Voices weighs law in a chamber with no throne. Above, towers glow with brass light. Below, the Undercogs trades breath for veinstone and silence for coin.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Crucible Yards:</strong> bays of brass and glass where rune-cores are tested. A clean burn lights the skyline. A bad burn scorches cobbles and tolls a day of bells. Apprentices learn to hear a true coil-hum before they ever touch a tool.</li>
      <li><strong>Ironwade Canals:</strong> brick arches over slow water and barge wakes that glitter with ash. Each year the bells toll for the firestorm of 521 AE, and lanterns drift downriver with the names of the dead.</li>
      <li><strong>Sky-docks:</strong> coil cranes, tarred ropes, and storm charts pinned beside casualty lists. Captains study weather as carefully as tariffs. One wrong figure can end a fleet.</li>
      <li><strong>The Undercogs:</strong> slag alleys, dripping pipes, and debt-courts held in shadow. Veinstone passes hand to hand. Children scrape resin from furnace walls and cough black dust before they are grown.</li>
      <li><strong>Ledger Court:</strong> slate-robed arbiters read rulings that tilt markets across provinces. Merchants crowd the steps for the first whisper of a judgment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Days follow the bells. Dawn brings coil-bells and yard whistles. Dusk lights the canal lamps against smoke. Festivals are rare but bright: <strong>Lantern Night</strong> each spring sets the canals aglow for those lost to work, and <strong>Widowmaker’s March</strong> carries broken cannon shards through the streets to honor soldiers killed by failed volleys. Street songs speak of debts, drowned crews, and luck bought by coin.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The <strong>House of Voices</strong> governs from its tiered chamber. Seats rank by influence, not blood. Speaker <strong>Tirien Vale</strong> rings the bell that ends debate. <strong>Guildmaster Orvan Caldrin</strong> keeps Crucible contracts honest enough to sign. <strong>Arbiter Lethra Ansel</strong> writes rulings that move grain prices a province away. In the shadow, the <strong>Iron Veil cartel</strong> prices veinstone, their chalk mark on a doorframe warning enough.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>264 AE</strong> Veythmir is founded as the Crowned Kingdoms’ engine city. The Crucible of Iron and Aether lights its first furnaces.</li>
      <li><strong>289 AE</strong> The Iron Gull, first skyship, takes flight. Its core fails within an hour and crashes into Ironwade. Artificers rebuild and record every lesson.</li>
      <li><strong>312 AE</strong> Rune-cannons are tested in the yards. Misfires kill crews, and soldiers give the weapons the name Widowmakers.</li>
      <li><strong>364 AE</strong> Crowned skyships join the Broken Tide War. Ashkarra corsairs drag hulls from the sky with chain rigs, and losses mount with each season.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> The eclipse darkens the skies. The Northern Reach falls to the Black Ruin, and flux shipments cease. Veythmir rations light by the bell.</li>
      <li><strong>453 AE</strong> Rune-cannons are deployed in the Ashen Marches. Early volleys devastate Crown ranks and the Widowmaker curse hardens.</li>
      <li><strong>499 AE</strong> Veinstone is outlawed in the House of Voices. The Undercogs thrives on the ban as cartels grow rich and addicts crowd the alleys.</li>
      <li><strong>521 AE</strong> Six skyships collide above Ironwade during a storm. Fire rains into the canals and hundreds die. Civil flights are restricted to military writ.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>The Crucible pushes toward safer engines. Skyships sit under tarps until both storm charts and ledgers permit a launch. Cartels rule the Undercogs by night. Veinstone debts choke workers by day. The bells still toll each spring for the Ironwade dead. Veythmir moves forward and burns itself to keep moving.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Tirien Vale:</strong> Speaker of the House of Voices whose ring of the bell ends every argument.</li>
      <li><strong>Orvan Caldrin:</strong> Guildmaster of the Crucible, famed for contracts that keep the city supplied and the furnaces lit.</li>
      <li><strong>Lethra Ansel:</strong> Arbiter of Ledger Court whose written rulings can steady or sink a market.</li>
      <li><strong>Selan Vey:</strong> Chronicler banned from the Court who writes the gutter as boldly as the gallery.</li>
      <li><strong>The Iron Veil:</strong> A faceless cartel that controls most veinstone trade. Enforcers wear black veils marked with faint, heat-scored sigils.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>The Crucible of Iron and Aether</strong> is treated as a living thing by its apprentices. Many swear oaths to their coils and claim each crystal core has a voice. Some artificers say failed cores still hum in their sleep.</p>
        <p><strong>Veinstone</strong> offers flashes of clarity and steals the strength to live. Crushed from cracked rune-crystals, it stains veins black and reddens the eyes. Addicts sometimes speak half-true prophecies that courts and cartels both pay to hear.</p>
        <p><strong>Festivals and rites</strong> bind the city to its scars. Lantern Night sets the canals alight for the dead of work. Widowmaker’s March lets soldiers’ families carry shattered cannon shards through the streets.</p>
        <p><strong>The House of Voices</strong> is rumored to take cartel coin. Some seats are whispered to be bought. Even so, when the Speaker rings the bell the galleries fall quiet.</p>
        <p><strong>Rumors</strong> persist in the Undercogs: a hidden dock with a working skyship outside military writ, noble coin behind the Iron Veil, and black ice from the Ruin seeping under the city where no fire will take.</p>

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>Ashkarra</strong> is a cliff city of rigs, spans, and black sails. Crews gather beneath canyon bridges where the <strong>Chain Court</strong> weighs shares and feuds. <strong>Ember Courts</strong> call hands to service by torchlight. Shipwrights rebuild captured hulls in slipyards that never sleep. The Crowns call Ashkarra a nest of thieves. The locals call it a city paid for in grit and rope.</p>

    </div>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Slipyards</strong> rows of scaffold and tarps along the canyon water. Captured skyship frames are stripped for parts, then reborn with black rigging.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridge Forges</strong> cliff forges worked by the <strong>Shardmothers</strong>. Iron sings on the spans. Chains are tested over the drop.</li>
      <li><strong>Span Markets</strong> bazaar planks bolted to rope bridges. Charts, lantern oil, contraband tools, and Crown stamps shaved clean.</li>
      <li><strong>Ember Steps</strong> tiers of fire pits where crews take oaths at dusk. Names are shouted to the cliff walls so no one can claim they did not hear.</li>
      <li><strong>Gutter Docks</strong> low-water moorings in shadow. Smugglers ferry goods upriver and take coin from both sides of the law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Ashkarra lives by the rope. Every crew keeps a share-ledger. Every feud has rules. Lanterns are set for the drowned, and coins are tied to wrists before a hard run. Children learn knots before letters. Songs rise at night about rigs that never broke and runs that never slowed.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Chain Court</strong> settles disputes and sets shares. <strong>Matriarch Kaelen</strong> presides with a calm voice and a clear ledger. <strong>The Crimson Judge</strong> keeps outlaw justice at the spans. Yard master <strong>Korrin Chainbreaker</strong> runs the slipyards. <strong>Serayne Black Sail</strong> remains a legend. Her charts still guide night runs. The Crowns post bounties. Ashkarra posts prices.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Third Century AE</strong> Ashkarra corsair crews raid Crown tolls and depots. The name spreads along the river roads.</li>
      <li><strong>Third Century AE</strong> Serayne Black Sail rises. The Crimson Judge keeps outlaw justice at the spans.</li>
      <li><strong>364 AE</strong> Broken Tide War. Ashkarra captures Crown skyships with chain-shot and harpoons. Some hulls are rebuilt to fly black flags.</li>
      <li><strong>367 AE</strong> Orrek Flamesong unifies the highlands. Court posts are set in stone. The Chain Court takes root at the Cleft Spans.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> Korrin Chainbreaker and the Shardmothers expand the slipyards and bridge forges. Black-sail traffic fills the canyon winds.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> Matriarch Kaelen of the House of Chains rules the Chain Court. Ember Courts are full. The slipyards work by torchlight.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Ashkarra walks the line between legend and ledger. Crews sell seized cargo back to the same merchants who hired Crown escorts. Chain rigs hang ready to drag down the next skyship foolish enough to stray. At night, the canyon glows with forge-fire and the sound of hammers on chain.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Matriarch Kaelen of the House of Chains</strong> settles feuds and sets shares. Crews listen.</li>
      <li><strong>Serayne Black Sail</strong> famed raider and court voice. Her charts still guide night runs.</li>
      <li><strong>Korrin Chainbreaker</strong> yard master who rebuilt captured frames. Known for iron calm.</li>
      <li><strong>The Shardmothers</strong> founders of the cliff forges. They judge metal by sound.</li>
      <li><strong>The Crimson Judge</strong> the rope-law enforcer. Trials are short. Sentences are known.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Rope law</strong> binds Ashkarra. A share written at the spans stands across seas. Oathbreakers find no crew and no mooring.</p>
        <p><strong>Chain rigs</strong> are the city’s pride. Forged at the Bridge Forges, the hooks bite hulls hard. Corsairs train crews to fire, haul, and brace in one breath.</p>
        <p><strong>Sky trophies</strong> hang in the slipyards. Captured frames are refit with black canvas, then flown to scout Crown patrols and mask smugglers on the run.</p>
        <p><strong>Courts and coin</strong> keep order. The Chain Court sets the law. Ember Courts call hands when work is heavy. The city takes Crown coin, then spends it making ropes that will cut Crown sails.</p>

<!-- REGION: THE MAWRANGE -->

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>The Mawrange</strong> is the dragon spine of the realm. Peaks cut the horizon. Terraces hold stone cities. Law is oath before witness. Pilgrims climb with live coals cupped in iron bowls, proof that endurance is truth. In the high halls a council called the <strong>Horned Table</strong> weighs disputes that echo from peak to peak.</p>

    </div>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Kaelthwyn</strong> terraces a fortress into the cliff. Laws are carved in slate and sung aloud three times before they bind.</li>
      <li><strong>Ember Path</strong> a pilgrimage stair from valley to shrine. Those who reach the top with ember still burning are counted oath-true.</li>
      <li><strong>The Black Ruin</strong> a high frozen vent where heralds chalk each tool before work. Unmarked picks are shattered at the gate.</li>
      <li><strong>Horned Table Halls</strong> a council chamber set with seats carved from horn and bone. Verdicts are weighed by witness and chain.</li>
      <li><strong>Ridge Villages</strong> goat herders and terrace farmers who trade barley, cheese, and carved horn for steel and salt.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Honor here is a ledger of words. Oaths are recited at feasts. Names are tied to chains worn on the belt. Pilgrims train breath and foot alike, carrying coals up the Ember Path while wardens pace the stairs. Visitors repeat the laws aloud to be counted as bound.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Each stonehold rules its terraces, but the <strong>Horned Table</strong> binds the range. Highlord <strong>Cael Varros</strong> presides with scribes and matrons. <strong>Matron Elira Vey</strong> keeps the Emberwalk strict and fair. <strong>Warden Drenn Vol</strong> holds the passes and the caravan stairs. <strong>Herald Ankai</strong> listens to the frozen vent and reads storms from the ice.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pre-Crowning</strong> Pacts with dragon heralds shape law. Oath, guest right, and the Emberwalk take root.</li>
      <li><strong>0–150 AE</strong> The Emberwalk is formalized. The Horned Table hears the first realm-wide cases from low valleys to high holds.</li>
      <li><strong>108 AE</strong> Pact of the Horned Table renewed after southern wars. Caravan stairs reopen under warden escort.</li>
      <li><strong>312 AE</strong> Last descent of Arcteryax is witnessed from Kaelthwyn. Pilgrims claim the air sang like struck glass.</li>
      <li><strong>Fourth–Fifth Centuries AE</strong> Smugglers move unmarked crystal to Ashkarra. Public shatterings of false stones become rite and warning.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> The Table prepares to judge whether Crown tariffs bind Emberwalk pilgrims carrying relics. Letters arrive from the Baronies without a named sender.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>A terrace collapse near Kaelthwyn killed families and set three clans at odds. The Table weighs reparations while caravans idle at the stairs. Stolen Ruin crystals appear in Ashkarra with Mawrange runes filed off. The wardens sharpen spears and check the cloudline for storms.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cael Varros</strong> remembers every oath sworn to him. His chain is heavy and each link has a name.</li>
      <li><strong>Elira Vey</strong> keeps the Emberwalk honest. Pilgrims who falter try again under her eye.</li>
      <li><strong>Drenn Vol</strong> commands wardens across the high passes. Bandits last less than a season under his watch.</li>
      <li><strong>Herald Ankai</strong> marks tools at the Black Ruin vent and claims the ice sings before storms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Oath chains</strong> are carved by hand on Carvers’ Ledge. A chain worn at the belt shows who you trust and who trusts you. To break an oath is to wear empty links for a year.</p>
        <p><strong>Emberwalk signs</strong> line the stairs: red cloths tied to rails by those who passed, cracked bowls hung where embers died. Wardens read the stair like a book of lives.</p>
        <p><strong>Herald marks</strong> matter more than coin in the Ruin vents. A single chalk line on a tool means the ice will not take it that day. No one swings an unmarked pick twice.</p>
        <p><strong>Smugglers’ justice</strong> is public. False stones are shattered on the hall floor. The smuggler’s name is struck from clan rolls and never sung again.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> stay tense. Veythmir covets ore and crystal but distrusts oath-law. Ashkarra buys stolen stone and pays more than it should. The Baronies send wax-sealed letters that arrive warm and unsigned.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High Terrace Hall</strong> a vast chamber carved with horns of stone and dragon sigils. The Horned Table convenes here when disputes cross provinces.</li>
      <li><strong>Emberwalk Stairs</strong> the pilgrimage path that cuts through the city. Pilgrims who carry embers unquenched are marked with ash and given a place at feast tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Ash Vaults</strong> sealed crypts where oath-breakers are interred. Each vault is carved with their broken promises as a warning.</li>
      <li><strong>Dragon Carvers’ Quarter</strong> artisans carve horns, talons, and scales into ornament. Many claim their craft carries blessings of the Ancients.</li>
      <li><strong>Refuge Terraces</strong> districts built after 0 AE when survivors of the Black Ruin streamed into the Mawrange. Families still light braziers here in memory of their lost homes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Kaelthwyn life is measured in oaths. Every feast begins with recited promises, and every guest leaves marked with ash or salt to show trust. Pilgrims from across the realm climb the Emberwalk. Songs echo against the cliffs, recounting both dragon descents and mortal endurance. Markets sell goat cheese, barley bread, and carved horn. Outsiders are welcomed if they speak their names before witnesses.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Kaelthwyn is ruled by the <strong>High Warden</strong> but bound by the <strong>Horned Table</strong>. <strong>Serath Kaelwyn</strong> enforces judgments with a hard hand, overseeing both law and levy. <strong>Elder Delyra Moonsinger</strong> defends ancient groves. <strong>Brother Kaleth</strong> brought the Obsidian Steles here, adding their black stone to seasonal rituals. Matrons like <strong>Ysira the Ember-Voice</strong> lead rites of ash and fire for pilgrims.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primordial Age</strong> Founded in the scar where the Ancient Dragon Kax’Morvo split Emberpeak. Terraces were carved with dragon kin and mortal hand.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> Refugees fleeing the Black Ruin find safety in Kaelthwyn’s terraces. The Emberwalk becomes a rite of survival.</li>
      <li><strong>73 AE</strong> Aurora Spire is retaken. Envoys pass through Kaelthwyn, and the Horned Table begins to hear disputes beyond the Mawrange.</li>
      <li><strong>108 AE</strong> Pact of the Horned Table signed here. Dragons themselves bear witness. Arcteryax guides Chieftain Marros Ironhand to the council.</li>
      <li><strong>312 AE</strong> Last descent of Arcteryax. Witnesses describe sparks in the air and voices like struck glass.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> The Spire Bell shatters in a storm. Omen is read as warning. Crowned loggers are turned back by Elder Moonsinger’s defenders.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> Brother Kaleth raises Obsidian Steles in Kaelthwyn. Rites shift to weave black stone into pilgrim songs.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> Serath Kaelwyn II rules with iron judgment. The Horned Table meets without dragons. Refuge terraces now house second and third generations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Kaelthwyn endures as the heart of the Mawrange. Pilgrims climb the Emberwalk with coals. Wardens guard the stairs against bandits. The Horned Table debates trade tariffs with the Crowns and warnings from the Baronies. Some whisper the black ice is creeping closer, threading into the high passes. Still, the bells call pilgrims at dawn, and embers rise in the mountain dark.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Serath Kaelwyn II</strong> High Warden of Kaelthwyn, hard-handed enforcer of Table law.</li>
      <li><strong>Delyra Moonsinger</strong> Elder of the groves, who turned back Crowned loggers in the storm year.</li>
      <li><strong>Brother Kaleth of the Road</strong> pilgrim monk who raised Obsidian Steles and gave them into seasonal rites.</li>
      <li><strong>Ysira the Ember-Voice</strong> matron of pilgrim rites, who leads chants at Emberwalk feasts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>The Emberwalk</strong> marks each pilgrim’s endurance. Bowls of coal are carried from valley to summit. Those who finish are daubed with ash and called ember-true. Those who fail must try again next season.</p>
        <p><strong>Obsidian Steles</strong> stand at crossroads and terraces. Rumians wove them into their seasonal songs. In Kaelthwyn they are struck with iron rods at feast nights to echo across the terraces.</p>
        <p><strong>The Shattered Bell</strong> still lies cracked in its tower. Children climb it at festival time, and some claim it hums when storms roll across the peaks.</p>
        <p><strong>Oath-stones</strong> are carved at the Dragon Carvers’ Quarter. Pilgrims who reach the summit of the Emberwalk carve their promise into stone and leave it in the vaults.</p>
        <p><strong>Rumors</strong> whisper that black ice veins creep through the lower passes. Wardens deny it, but torchlight sometimes flickers against shadows that do not move.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Salt Gate</strong> the eastern gate cut into salt cliffs. Caravans pay tithe here before setting foot in the city.</li>
      <li><strong>Caravan Hall</strong> a broad colonnade where Syndics meet under banners of hide and cloth. Disputes are judged by tally of coin and camel.</li>
      <li><strong>Oasis Quarter</strong> wells ringed with shrines. Every family keeps a carved bowl filled here at least once a year in memory of the first survivors.</li>
      <li><strong>Glass Market</strong> a bazaar of colored shards from the Wastes where desert fire fused sand into glass. Cutters trade in prisms, lenses, and charms.</li>
      <li><strong>Refuge Cliffs</strong> terraces cut into the salt stone where Lady Veyra’s followers first built shelters. Lamps are still hung here on the night of remembrance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Salt’s Rest lives by caravan rhythm. Dawn horns call traders to the markets. Dusk bells send guards to the walls against raiders. Every year the <strong>Day of Remembrance</strong> marks the survival of the founding with lamps hung on the cliffs. Songs tell of the eight thousand who walked from ruin, and each child learns their names. Wealth is counted in water jars and caravan contracts more than in gold.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Caravan Syndicates</strong> rule from the Hall, each Syndic holding sway over routes and gates. <strong>Syndic Torren Veyrald</strong> expanded the routes east and made Salt’s Rest the heart of desert trade. Lady <strong>Veyra</strong> is remembered as founder and savior, her shrine stands in the Refuge Cliffs. The <strong>Glasscutters’ Guild</strong> wields influence by controlling shards from the Blind Wastes, used in charms and spyglasses alike.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> Lady Veyra leads eight thousand survivors east after the fall of Cindralith. Salt’s Rest is founded at the cliffs.</li>
      <li><strong>First–Second Centuries AE</strong> Caravans establish routes across the Blind Wastes. Syndicates rise to protect and tax them.</li>
      <li><strong>225–243 AE</strong> During the Ledger Wars, Salt’s Rest grows rich as Crowned coin flows through the desert routes.</li>
      <li><strong>Third–Fourth Centuries AE</strong> Caravans expand further east and south. Skathra raids force heavier fortifications at the Salt Gate.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> The Syndicates form a council, turning the Hall into the city’s seat of power. Refuge cliffs become holy ground.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> Caravans run heavy. The Wastes shift, swallowing old roads. Salt’s Rest thrives but fears the next tide of the Ruin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Salt’s Rest is a city of bargains. Caravan banners crowd the Hall. Wells are guarded day and night. Syndics trade routes and rumors while raiders stalk the Wastes. To the south the Skathra grow restless, and to the west the Baronies send black coin that spends the same as any other. Yet the lamps still burn on remembrance night, and the city still calls itself the place that endures.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lady Veyra</strong> founder and savior, who led the march east and gave the city its life.</li>
      <li><strong>Torren Veyrald</strong> Syndic who built the strongest of the caravan routes and tied the city to far provinces.</li>
      <li><strong>The Caravan Syndicates</strong> merchant families whose banners mark the gates. They travel roads sharing stories always on the search for things to upurpose or sell.</li>
      <li><strong>The Glasscutters’ Guild</strong> artisans who shape shards of desert glass into lenses, charms, and weapons.</li>
    </ul>

      <div>
        <p><strong>Remembrance Night</strong> sees lamps lit on the Refuge Cliffs for the dead of Cindralith. Each lamp is named for one of the eight thousand.</p>
        <p><strong>Desert glass</strong> forms where ancient fire fused sand. Cutters claim some shards still hum with the storm that made them.</p>
        <p><strong>Caravan omens</strong> include salt spilled at the gate, which means a caravan must turn back, and broken reins, which mean a death on the road.</p>
        <p><strong>Water vows</strong> are made at the Oasis Quarter. A drink given freely binds two people as kin for a season. Breaking the vow stains a family for years.</p>
        <p><strong>Rumors</strong> speak of black ice veins showing in the southern Wastes. Caravan scouts whisper of frozen spires taller than towers half-buried in sand.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Spire Crown</strong> — Upper halls where the Council of Barons meet in masks. Decisions are read aloud by heralds beneath lanterns that burn cold.</li>
      <li><strong>Umberlight Gate</strong> — The ancient gate forged of fae alloy. It cracked during the eclipse and its shards glow faintly before storms. Families keep fragments in their homes as wards.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood Court</strong> — Central square where contracts are signed with ink and blood. Trials are held here on no moon nights, and sentences are carried out before dawn.</li>
      <li><strong>Boneworks</strong> — Black forges where revenant armor and weapons are set with runes. Bone plates marked with names are cut and issued for binding the dead.</li>
      <li><strong>Lantern Warrens</strong> — Narrow streets under curfew. Families hood lamps and redraw chalk wards at dusk. Patrols walk the alleys in silence.</li>
      <li><strong>Shroud Docks</strong> — River landings beneath the cliffs. Barges unload under torchlight and sail before moonrise. Cargo is rarely inspected and contracts are signed on the pier stones.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life in Greyspire is lived in daylight. At sunset, the bells toll and streets empty. Garlic and chalk wards hang over thresholds. Nobles wear masks and titles rather than names. Common folk speak softly of which families trade blood coin and which alleys to avoid after dark. Shards of Umberlight sit in many homes, glowing faintly on storm nights as both ward and warning.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Greyspire is ruled by the <strong>Council of Barons</strong>. Power is shared uneasily between vampiric dynasties, wolf cursed nobles, and revenant warlords. <strong>Baron Malvek Iron Pyre</strong> commands revenant cohorts clad in ash and iron. <strong>Mistress Sarela Veyne</strong> oversees the <strong>Black Lyceum</strong>, training apprentices in necromancy. <strong>Baroness Ysera Wolfthorn</strong> leads cursed hunts across the moors. <strong>Varros Lysarin</strong> of Vyranithar ties Greyspire’s contracts into wider markets. Alliances shift constantly, but the Black Lyceum’s influence reaches into every ruling.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>162 AE</strong> — Founded by Ilyra Greyhand. Greythrone established as a kingdom and sworn ally of the Crowns.</li>
      <li><strong>Second to Third Centuries AE</strong> — Greythrone prospers. The Lyceum of Oaths teaches oath magic and law spells.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — Eclipse darkens the skies. Plague spreads, vampiric curse takes root, and the Sword of Umberlight shatters.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Greythrone collapses. Nobles fracture into rival barons. The Lyceum of Oaths becomes the Black Lyceum, teaching necromancy and revenant binding.</li>
      <li><strong>Sixth Century AE</strong> — Greyspire endures as the capital of the Night Baronies, feared for its revenant legions and blood oaths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Greyspire is the heart of the Night Baronies. Revenant soldiers patrol the moors, contracts are written in blood, and the Black Lyceum whispers curses into iron and bone. Merchants from Veythmir and Salt’s Rest come under guard and leave with deals sealed in iron and silence. Rumors spread that shards of the Sword of Umberlight sing faintly when storms gather, a sign the old blade may not be fully gone.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baroness Serel of Greyspire</strong> — Claims descent from the Greyhands and chairs council sessions.</li>
      <li><strong>Baron Malvek Iron Pyre</strong> — Commands revenant armies bound by branded seals.</li>
      <li><strong>Mistress Sarela Veyne</strong> — Vampire archmage who leads the Black Lyceum.</li>
      <li><strong>Baroness Ysera Wolfthorn</strong> — Wolf cursed noble who rules the moors by hunt and blood pact.</li>
      <li><strong>Varros Lysarin</strong> — Merchant patriarch of Vyranithar, his contracts reach deep into Greyspire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Blood oaths</strong> are sworn over iron basins etched with moon sigils. A sworn drop turns black, and breaking the oath leaves a mark that no cloth can hide.</p>
        <p><strong>Revenant binding</strong> requires a bone plate marked with a name placed beneath the tongue. The revenant rises armored and serves until the plate is shattered.</p>
        <p><strong>Curfew rites</strong> begin at sunset. Doors are washed with salt, chalk wards redrawn, and lamps hooded. Patrols tap shutters once to mark a street as watched.</p>
        <p><strong>Moon trials</strong> take place in the Blood Court on nights without a moon. The accused stands on the stone; if frost gathers beneath their feet, the charge is proven.</p>
        <p><strong>Umberlight shards</strong> glow faintly when storms approach. Families use them as lantern wards, listening for changes in tone that warn of danger.</p>
        <p><strong>Hidden stairs</strong> descend beneath the Umberlight Gate into mirrored halls. Some who return walk with careful steps and lowered voices. Others do not return at all.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Moonspire Heights</strong> — The Black Moonspire rises over the city. Its halls are lit by pale shard-lamps that never dim. Nobles gather here in velvet courts.</li>
      <li><strong>Lysar Halls</strong> — Seat of <strong>House Lysar</strong>, known for its contracts and marriages that bind half the baronies. Varros Lysarin is its current patriarch.</li>
      <li><strong>Veyth Courts</strong> — Seat of <strong>House Veyth</strong>, where Isolde Veyth holds masked audiences and dispatches agents across the provinces.</li>
      <li><strong>Orenn Ruins</strong> — The shattered halls of House Orenn, left to ivy and silence. Revenants prowl the ruins, bound to names no longer spoken.</li>
      <li><strong>Candle Market</strong> — A night market where traders sell relics, forbidden tomes, and bone charms. Lanterns are shaded red to hide pale faces.</li>
      <li><strong>Flooded Wards</strong> — Old river quarters drowned by rising water after the eclipse. Barges pole between half-submerged houses where smugglers hide their stores.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life in Vyranithar follows the moon. Courts meet at night, and markets open after dusk. Masks are common, both for nobles and for common folk who fear recognition. Families leave blood offerings at doorsteps during the new moon to avoid summons by the houses. Candlelight is used more than flame, and silence is respected as much as speech. Outsiders are tolerated but watched, and contracts made in the Black Moonspire are said to bind even the unwilling.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The city is ruled by the <strong>Black Moonspire</strong>, where <strong>House Lysar</strong> and <strong>House Veyth</strong> hold power. <strong>Varros Lysarin</strong> manages trade and contracts, tying Vyranithar into the economies of the Crowns and Greyspire. <strong>Isolde Veyth</strong> governs the shadow courts, her agents enforcing blood pacts and silencing rivals. The <strong>Black Archivists</strong> keep records of every pact, while the <strong>Pale Custodians</strong> patrol the Candle Market and Flooded Wards.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>187 AE</strong> — Vyranithar founded by Houses Lysar, Veyth, and Orenn. Built as a city of law and learning.</li>
      <li><strong>312 AE</strong> — Arcteryax’s last descent witnessed by Lysar envoys at Kaelthwyn, later recorded in the Moonspire ledgers.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — Eclipse brings plague and famine. House Orenn is destroyed. Houses Lysar and Veyth turn to vampiric rites to survive.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Vyranithar allies with Greyspire after Greythrone’s fall. The Black Moonspire becomes the seat of vampiric dynasties.</li>
      <li><strong>612 AE</strong> — The city vanishes from outside view for a year, shrouded in shadow. When it returns, the Black Moonspire gleams darker than before.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Vyranithar endures as a feared seat of the Night Baronies. Its contracts shape wars and trade across the realm.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Today Vyranithar stands as a place of moonlit courts and whispered bargains. Greyspire looks to it as an equal, and traders from Veythmir and Salt’s Rest come at risk to secure contracts. Revenants and pale custodians keep order. Rumors say the Black Moonspire’s highest chambers contain mirrors that show no reflection, and that the dynasties keep records written in blood rather than ink.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Varros Lysarin</strong> — Patriarch of House Lysar, master of contracts and trade.</li>
      <li><strong>Isolde Veyth</strong> — Matriarch of House Veyth, ruler of the shadow courts.</li>
      <li><strong>The Black Archivists</strong> — Scribes who record every pact sworn in the Moonspire, using ink mixed with ash.</li>
      <li><strong>The Pale Custodians</strong> — Enforcers of curfew and silence in the markets and wards.</li>
      <li><strong>Lady Calira of Orenn</strong> — Last scion of House Orenn, said to haunt the ruins of her house as a revenant bound to her own name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Blood ledgers</strong> are kept in the Moonspire. A pact written here cannot be undone without equal sacrifice. Some ledgers bear centuries of names, many now ash.</p>
        <p><strong>Moon rites</strong> guide the city. New moon nights demand blood offerings on thresholds. Full moons see hunts led by House Veyth across the floodplains.</p>
        <p><strong>Revenant wards</strong> stand in the Orenn Ruins. Names carved into stone keep bound dead from leaving. When storms break, the wards hum like low bells.</p>
        <p><strong>Shadow contracts</strong> bind not only signatories but their heirs. Families mark newborns with ink to track obligations across generations.</p>
        <p><strong>Rumors</strong> whisper that the year-long vanishing of 612 AE was not disappearance but ascension — that the city walked briefly in the fae night and returned altered.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Star Chamber</strong> : A round hall with a rotating ceiling grid. Brass pins mark constellations and drift a finger’s width each season.</li>
      <li><strong>Prism Vaults</strong> : Cold stacks where thin crystal plates are etched with star paths, storm tracks, and prophecy lines. Plates are sung before use.</li>
      <li><strong>Lightwell Courts</strong> : Open courts cut to the sky. During auroras the paving shows moving bands used to time long calculations.</li>
      <li><strong>Wind Stairs</strong> : Exterior steps carved along the lee face. Bells in niches warn of ice gust and mark watch change.</li>
      <li><strong>North Watch</strong> : A high gallery with shuttered lenses. Logs track Tharuk signs, black ice veining, and lights that break known bands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life at the Spire is quiet and precise. Voices drop in the vaults so plate edges do not chatter. Meals are simple and eaten standing after the night watch. Apprentices copy charts by oil lamp and learn to read wind at the Lightwells. Visitors sleep in narrow cells and are woken before dawn to hear the plates ring while the sky is still dark.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The Spire is held by the <strong>Prism Wardens</strong> under the Arcanum. The <strong>Archwarden</strong> sets rotations, approves chart copies, and speaks with clan chiefs when routes or wards must change. The <strong>Prism Scribes</strong> manage records and admit petitioners to the Vaults. When danger signs are logged, the Archwarden signals allied halls by coded lens and the Polar North clans by bell and fire.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primordial</strong>: The Spire stands in crystal and old stone. First keepers are remembered as Wardens Before Names.</li>
      <li><strong>Late Old Era</strong>: War of Shattered Skies marks the north. Records note bands of light that shift with omen force.</li>
      <li><strong>73 AE</strong> : <strong>Selune Kael</strong> restores the Spire and reopens the Vaults. The Arcanum formalizes the Prism branch here.</li>
      <li><strong>Third to Fourth Centuries AE</strong>: Chart work expands. Sea routes, ice lines, and storm bands are copied for Polar North pilots.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong>: The Spire watches the slow creep of black ice and keeps wards tuned to Tharuk signs. Copies travel south by trusted hands only.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>The Prism lamps burn steady. Wardens listen for faults in the plates and adjust ward lines as bands shift. Clan boats come each season for new charts and safe marks. Messengers carry sealed packets to Veythmir, Kaelthwyn, and Greyspire when sky signs cross into danger readings. Doors are unbarred in daylight and shuttered by first dark.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archwarden Selune Kael</strong>  Retook the Spire in 73 AE and set the Prism Archive in order.</li>
      <li><strong>Keeper Anareth</strong> : Senior Warden of the Vaults who trains apprentices in plate song and lens work.</li>
      <li><strong>The Prism Wardens</strong> watch officers who maintain ward lines and teach navigation.</li>
      <li><strong>The Prism Scribes</strong> Record keepers who etch plates, file omen lines, and issue chart copies.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Plate song</strong> tests a new etching. A true plate rings and holds tone. A false plate stutters and is ground away rather than trusted.</p>
        <p><strong>Omen lines</strong> are traced when lights hold a color out of season. Three confirmed matches trigger advisories to clan chiefs and southern halls.</p>
        <p><strong>Ward tuning</strong> is done at the Lightwells. Four lenses are set to the bands and adjusted by iron screws while a scribe logs each turn.</p>
        <p><strong>Silent hours</strong> are kept after midnight. No one speaks in the Vaults. Apprentices learn to read flaws by touch and breath while the aurora moves overhead.</p>

It was first settled in the Old Era by <strong>Queen-Seer Myrrha</strong> of the Talarin Clan, who spoke prophecies in the dark that shaped tribes and thrones alike. The cave became a seat of visions, a place where kings sent envoys and commoners left votives. By the Fifth Century AE, cults gathered there, weaving new orders from the Seer’s fading words.

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Seer’s Hall</strong> The main central chamber where Myrrha gave her visions. A dais of black stone still stands, scarred with deep cuts.</li>
      <li><strong>Echo Pools</strong> — Still waters that reflect lights in strange colors. Pilgrims throw coins and listen for answers in the ripples.</li>
      <li><strong>Shard Galleries</strong> — Corridors lined with crystal veins. Chipped shards glow faintly when held, prized as relics.</li>
      <li><strong>Pilgrim Steps</strong> — Carved stairways descending into the cavern. Each step is inscribed with names of supplicants across centuries.</li>
      <li><strong>Deep Warrens</strong> — Tunnels without map or end. Cultists claim the Seer still whispers here. Few return whole.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Pilgrims come in silence, leaving food, cloth, or blood drops at the Pools. Cults keep vigil by shardlight, fasting and listening for echoes that bend into words. Wardens at the cave mouth record offerings and levy tolls for the Crowns. Local families carry charms said to descend from the Seer’s first prophecies, kept in lockboxes or sewn into garments.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No lord rules the Cave, but cults guard its depths fiercely. The <strong>Shardmothers</strong> lead vigils, controlling relic shards and access to the Pools. The Crowns post guards at the entrance to tax pilgrims and restrain unrest. The Night Baronies send spies to hear omens before raids. Between them, the Cave survives as contested ground, half holy site and half political tool.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>c. 1500 BE</strong> — Queen-Seer Myrrha of the Talarin Clan first settles the cave and speaks her visions.</li>
      <li><strong>Old Era</strong> — Envoys from kings and tribes visit to hear prophecy. Votives and carvings cover the walls.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — The Black Ruin spreads. Cults claim Myrrha foresaw its path, though records are uncertain.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — The cave becomes a cult seat. Shardmothers rise, each claiming descent from the Seer’s bloodline.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Pilgrims still come, Cartels sell shards, and the Deep Warrens whisper. No one agrees if the true voice of Myrrha still speaks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>At dawn, pilgrims wait at the cave mouth, clutching offerings. By night, shardlight glows in the galleries as cult chants echo. Guards watch the steps with spears while merchants sell charms in the market above. Deep inside, the Warrens twist and drop, and sometimes a voice speaks in a tone all listeners swear was meant for them alone.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Queen-Seer Myrrha</strong> — Founder of the cave, remembered as both prophet and queen.</li>
      <li><strong>The Shardmothers</strong> — Cult leaders who hold relic shards and claim authority through bloodline or vision.</li>
      <li><strong>Oracle Veynar</strong> — A wandering priest who records cave whispers in iron ink, feared for accuracy.</li>
      <li><strong>Keeper Althir</strong> — Oldest guard of the steps, known for burning false shards with no fear of cult reprisal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Shardlight</strong> burns cold. Carried into a room, it hums faintly in the ear of the bearer. Too much exposure makes dreams turn to ash and glass.</p>
        <p><strong>Echo rites</strong> call for total silence. A whispered word is repeated three times in the Pools. If the echo returns as song, the omen is taken as good. If it returns as broken sound, it is a curse.</p>
        <p><strong>Warren marks</strong> are carved arrows in old walls. Some point to safety, others to dead ends where only cultists walk. The oldest are worn smooth by fingers over centuries.</p>
        <p><strong>Blood votives</strong> are rare but feared. A drop spilled into a Pool makes ripples that some say Myrrha herself rides, speaking in clear tone.</p>
        <p><strong>False shards</strong> glow for a day then die. Real shards keep their light forever, dim or bright, no matter the holder.</p>

        <p><strong>Alithanthia</strong> is a woodland realm built on oath law. Its seat is <strong>Elessus</strong>, where notaries record pacts with the fae. The deepest crossings lie in the <strong>Greatwood</strong>, a stand of colossal redwoods guarded by elven houses who act as protectors rather than kings. Order comes from the <strong>Silent Court</strong>, whose oaths bind harvests, roads, and river rights. </p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Elessus Notarial Halls</strong> — Vaults of pact writs sealed in ash and gall. Quills hang at the belts of clerks to show rank and duty.</li>
      <li><strong>Warden Circles</strong> — Stone rings where oaths are sung and witnessed, then entered into the ledgers.</li>
      <li><strong>Dawn Glade</strong> — Treaty ground where the Court of Dawn hears petitions at first light.</li>
      <li><strong>Twilight Market</strong> — Night stalls under the eaves where safe-passage tokens and small promises are traded.</li>
      <li><strong>Greatwood Crossings</strong> — Hidden paths beneath redwoods that touch the fae. Elves keep these routes veiled and turn back trespassers. </li>
      <li><strong>River Steps</strong> — Landing stairs for envoy barges and trade boats at the Elessus quays. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Words are kept like coin. Children learn to avoid speaking full names and to leave offerings at crossroads. Villages carry wreaths of thorn over doors, and disputes pause when ward bells ring. The elves of the Greatwood serve as witnesses and guards at crossings. They are not monarchs, but their word carries weight where the redwood roots run deep. </p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Authority rests with oaths sworn to the <strong>Silent Court</strong>. Elessus notaries record the terms, <strong>Wardens</strong> and Greatwood elves enforce them on mortal soil. The Court’s envoys appear without sound when called, and judgments stand with or without a crown to back them.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>c. 1870 BE</strong> — <strong>Hareth I</strong> binds the first grove pacts and establishes Elessus as the seat. </li>
      <li><strong>950–870 BE</strong> — <strong>River Wars</strong> with the Caravel kings. Twilight riders fight beside Alithanthian hosts. Both sides are weakened. </li>
      <li><strong>Old Era</strong> — <strong>Queen Esra I</strong> strengthens Twilight ties. <strong>King Jorath II</strong> offends the fae with written contracts, fixing the rule that pacts must be oral and ritual. </li>
      <li><strong>The Pact of Oaks</strong> — Oath sworn beneath the redwoods, later extended to Rumia, binding the forests against fire. </li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — The three-day eclipse and its plagues shake neighboring realms. Alithanthia holds to oath ground and avoids collapse. </li>
      <li><strong>Fourth Century AE</strong> — <strong>Queen Sereth I the Greenwood</strong> renews treaties and restores Alithanthia’s strength. </li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — The realm continues under fae oaths. Crossings remain guarded, and Elessus reads pacts for neighbors who trust its ledgers. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Alithanthia trades timber, herbs, and pact services by river. Envoys from the Crowns and Salt’s Rest come to Elessus to have contracts read. Letters from the Night Baronies are opened in daylight and answered with strict terms. The Court’s presence is quiet but constant. </p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hareth I the Binder of Groves</strong> — Founder of the grove pacts and the Elessus seat.</li>
      <li><strong>Queen Sereth I the Greenwood</strong> — Restorer of treaties in the Fourth Century AE.</li>
      <li><strong>High Notary Edravel</strong> — Mortal head of Elessus who keeps the ledgers balanced.</li>
      <li><strong>Lady Thariel of the Boughs</strong> — Elven matriarch charged with guarding the Greatwood crossings. </li>
      <li><strong>The Pale Herald</strong> — Silent envoy of the Court who oversees oaths. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
<details class="canon" open>
  <summary>Extended lore</summary>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Oath Law</strong> governs Alithanthia more tightly than blades or coin. Promises are spoken aloud in the presence of witnesses and marked by branch-cut staves, river stones, or written entries in the Elessus ledgers. Breaking an oath is more than dishonor: it stains the breaker’s shadow, which the Silent Court can see even across leagues. Those so marked find doors closing against them and trade offers falling silent.</p>
    <p><strong>The Silent Court</strong> does not rule from a palace. Its envoys arrive unbidden, pale and wordless, to hear the terms of a pact. They write nothing themselves; they only nod or turn away. If they nod, the oath is bound. If they turn, the oath is void. When they depart, no trace remains save the certainty that the pact has weight. Stories tell of rulers who tried to deceive the Court; their names are no longer spoken in Alithanthia, as if erased.</p>
    <p><strong>Fae Crossings</strong> thread the Greatwood. At certain roots and hollows, the forest bends, and a traveler may find themselves on the edges of the Dawn or Twilight Courts. The elves of the Greatwood patrol these crossings with vigilance. Trespassers are turned away gently if lucky, but more often they vanish into the green silence. On solstice nights the crossings flare brighter, and whole caravans halt rather than risk stepping where roads bend wrong.</p>
    <p><strong>Rites of the Realm</strong> shape daily life. The <em>Tithe of Names</em> records family lines at Elessus to shield them from fae claim. The <em>Crossing Feast</em> marks the opening of a season’s travel: bread baked with salt and honey is broken across the road so both mortals and fae may pass in peace. The <em>Three Refusals</em> is an old custom — an offer may only be accepted after it is declined three times, a safeguard against enchantment and rash bargains.</p>
    <p><strong>Whispers and Rumors</strong> tell of a <em>white road</em> that sometimes appears in fog, leading from the river steps of Elessus into the heart of the Greatwood. Those who walk it without permission vanish. Some return years later, unchanged in body but with eyes that no longer blink. Others come back with no memory of their kin. The notaries mark these as “fae-touched” and watch them carefully, for their oaths often twist into new shapes.</p>

        <p><strong>The Crowned Kingdoms</strong> are a federation held together by the <strong>House of Voices</strong>, a circular chamber with no throne. Provinces speak by influence, not by crown. The realm grew on grain, coal, river trade, and careful law. It rose to test skyships and arcane cannon, then staggered when the <strong>Northern Reach</strong> was lost to the Black Ruin.

    <h3>Provinces</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cindral</strong> — Symbolic heart. The House of Voices stands here. Clerks record votes and levy script.</li>
      <li><strong>Verdant Reach</strong> — Grain and orchards. Granaries feed cities and armies.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashen Marches</strong> — Coal pits, foundries, levy soldiers. Cannon yards and rail sheds.</li>
      <li><strong>Thorned Coast</strong> — Silk, salt, and swift ships. Docks thick with ropewalks and smugglers.</li>
      <li><strong>Ironwade</strong> — Rivers and canals packed with barges. Toll houses, lock gates, counting houses.</li>
      <li><strong>Highspire Vale</strong> — Mountain passes and keeps. Drilled regiments and fortress towns.</li>
      <li><strong>Northern Reach</strong> — Lost to the Black Ruin in 417 AE. Its foundries and sky-docks lie under ice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>House of Voices</strong> — Circular hall with tiered seats by influence. Debates end at the Speaker’s bell. No throne is kept.</li>
      <li><strong>Ironwade Canals</strong> — Lock steps and warehouse arches. Barges run by bell schedule and ledger stamp.</li>
      <li><strong>Thorned Coast Docks</strong> — Fast cutters line the quays. Captains post piracy lists beside hiring boards.</li>
      <li><strong>Ashen Marches Foundries</strong> — Smelters and cannon pits. Widowmaker crews drill with oil buckets and prayer cloths.</li>
      <li><strong>Verdant Reach Granaries</strong> — Brick silos and mill races. Harvest inspectors tally weights at the gate.</li>
      <li><strong>Highspire Keeps</strong> — Watch towers and supply depots that guard the passes to Greyspire and Ashkarra.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>In market towns the day belongs to bells. Canal crews eat on the move and sleep by cargo. Foundry shifts change at the furnace whistle. Festivals are civic rather than sacred: river blessing at thaw, charter days at midsummer, memorials for accidents at year end. Contraband devices and veinstone still drift through alleys though the ban stands. Street hands know cartel chalk marks and which doors will exchange coin for silence.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The <strong>House of Voices</strong> binds the provinces. Votes are weighted by levy paid, grain sent, and fleets maintained. <strong>Maelen of Cindral</strong> is remembered as the First Voice who gathered the provinces in 251 AE. Today <strong>Speaker Tirien Vale</strong> keeps the bell and the docket. <strong>Guildmaster Orvan Caldrin</strong> and <strong>Arbiter Lethra Ansel</strong> steer industry and law from Veythmir’s ledgers. Unnamed cartels purchase influence with steady patience, and proxies sit in respectable seats.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>251 AE</strong> — The seven provinces unite in the House of Voices. No throne is declared. Maelen of Cindral is hailed as First Voice.</li>
      <li><strong>289 AE</strong> — First skyship trial at Veythmir. The Iron Gull flies, then fails over Ironwade.</li>
      <li><strong>364 AE</strong> — Skyships enter war against Ashkarra corsairs. The Broken Tide War bleeds coffers.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — Three day eclipse. Plague spreads. The Northern Reach is swallowed by the Black Ruin. Refugees flood south.</li>
      <li><strong>453 AE</strong> — Rune-cannons deployed on the Marches. Misfires kill crews. Widowmaker becomes common speech.</li>
      <li><strong>499 AE</strong> — Veinstone banned. Cartel profit rises. Arrest ledgers swell.</li>
      <li><strong>521 AE</strong> — Skyship disaster over Ironwade. Civil flights restricted to military writ.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Prosperity holds, but divisions widen. Cartels maneuver, borders strain, and the bell in the House rings longer each session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>The Crowns run hot and cold at once. Foundries belch and canals shine, but votes buy less peace than before. Ashkarra raids pick at sea and sky. Greyspire’s contracts come sealed in wax the color of dried blood. The House of Voices still holds the center, yet many whisper that the next decision will be taken with soldiers rather than speeches.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maelen of Cindral</strong> — The First Voice who bound the provinces without a throne.</li>
      <li><strong>Speaker Tirien Vale</strong> — Presides over the House, sets the docket, rings the bell to end debate.</li>
      <li><strong>Guildmaster Orvan Caldrin</strong> — Veythmir magnate who keeps the Crucible burning and the contracts paid.</li>
      <li><strong>Arbiter Lethra Ansel</strong> — Judge of Ledger Court whose rulings tilt markets across the provinces.</li>
      <li><strong>The Cartel Councilors</strong> — Respectable faces with shadow money. Their votes arrive on time and without speeches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>House procedure</strong> begins with the Bell of Balance. Speakers stand on numbered rings. Stepping beyond one’s ring without leave is contempt and fines a year’s levy.</p>
        <p><strong>Cartel signs</strong> mark stone and door. A black hand means debt is due. A white coin offers work no clerk will record. A red slash warns a witness saw too much.</p>
        <p><strong>Ichor distillation</strong> is licensed, but most fuel comes from the Sable Fens under penal contracts. Barrels carry a bitter smell that clings to rope and hair.</p>
        <p><strong>Skyship rites</strong> bless the core with salt and oil. Crews touch the hull where the keel joins the spine and keep a nail from the first dock as a charm.</p>
        <p><strong>Levy script</strong> pays soldiers in notes redeemable at House banks. In the slums the notes trade at a loss to moneylenders who sell them back whole to the banks.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ruin Edge</strong> — The ragged boundary where frost kills grass in a line. Survey stakes and iron nails show the crawl of the front year by year.</li>
      <li><strong>Glass Fields</strong> — Plains where old heat fused sand into black panes. Crews cut sheets as wards and sell them far from the edge.</li>
      <li><strong>Frozen Docks</strong> — Piers, hulls, and nets held mid motion. Oars hang like bones. A whisper carries only a few steps.</li>
      <li><strong>Silent Hollows</strong> — Streets of iced houses where torches burn low and boots do not echo.</li>
      <li><strong>Black Wall</strong> — A cliff of ice pressed with broken towers. Salvagers set iron pegs, work on warm days, and haul relics by rope.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>No one lives inside the Ruin. Life gathers at the edge. Camps eat hot stew quickly so it does not chill in the bowl. New hands are taught to watch their breath and to turn back when the flame begins to hiss. Prayer boards hold chalk names of those who stepped onto the ice and did not return.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No ruler commands the Ruin. At the edge, <strong>Salt’s Rest</strong> issues salvage permits and buys glass. Crown auditors weigh loads and take tax. Night Barony tithe posts count caravans. Wardens from the Spire keep ledgers of the creep and record when the ice rings under nail.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — A wall of black ice advances. <strong>Cindralith</strong> falls with King Thalen Marath. <strong>Lady Veyra</strong> leads eight thousand east and lays the first laws of <strong>Salt’s Rest</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>0 to 20 AE</strong> — Refugees pour into the Mawrange. <strong>Kaelthwyn</strong> shelters thousands in dragon halls and on terrace springs. Ashkarra swells with exiles and outlaws.</li>
      <li><strong>73 AE</strong> — <strong>Aurora Spire</strong> is retaken by Archwarden Selune Kael. Wardens begin shared charts of the Ruin’s path and send warnings along the trade roads.</li>
      <li><strong>108 AE</strong> — <strong>Pact of the Horned Table</strong> at Kaelthwyn. Dragons withdraw from mortal wars. Mountain passes remain open for relief, salvage, and flight.</li>
      <li><strong>First Age</strong> — <strong>Ashkarra Secession</strong> begins. Skathra tribes form in the south and raid salvage lines along the edge. Mage scholars gather remnants of lore and found the <strong>Arcanum</strong> to keep knowledge from vanishing.</li>
      <li><strong>Later centuries</strong> — Camps become semi permanent. Edge work turns from panic to craft. Charts agree on a slow league per generation. Obsidian Steles appear in the fifth century to tally the dead and mark safe routes.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — During the eclipse the edge surges. The <strong>Northern Reach</strong> is swallowed. Foundries and sky docks vanish under the ice. Refugees flood south.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — The Black Wall grows higher. Crews work the face when winds ease. The three heralds are still seen by those who keep the stakes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Dawn shows the front blue and dull. Noon turns it to oil shine. By evening the stoves burn low. Surveyors hammer new nails and chalk the date. When the air goes very still, the ice rings like a cup and everyone takes one slow step back.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Iscra the White</strong> — A pale shape seen where breath freezes without wind.</li>
      <li><strong>Drolth the Maw</strong> — A moving shadow that leaves glass in its wake. Nets snag on nothing after it passes.</li>
      <li><strong>Kaelth the Silent</strong> — A pocket of stillness that eats sound. Torches burn without smoke along its path.</li>
      <li><strong>Lady Veyra of Salt’s Rest</strong> — Led the first great exodus and wrote the edge rules that caravans still follow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Heat drink</strong> is measured by brand time. If a brand cools before a slow count of twelve, crews call the day bad and pull back.</p>
        <p><strong>Ring tests</strong> use a nail and a tin cup. A clear ring means movement underfoot. Work stops and the stake is marked with chalk lines and date.</p>
        <p><strong>Edge rules</strong> say iron first, rope second, wood last. Iron holds. Rope turns hard. Wood splinters with no warning.</p>
        <p><strong>Glass wards</strong> cut from the Black Wall are set in doors far from the edge. People say such panes turn ill luck aside.</p>
        <p><strong>Herald slates</strong> stand in every camp. Three chalk signs record which figure was seen last and from what line of stakes.</p>

    <h3>Baronies & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Greyspire Crown</strong> — Masks on the council benches. Petitions read by lamp. Revenant guards stand with mouths sewn shut.</li>
      <li><strong>Moor Keeps</strong> — Hill forts with Blood Court stones and iron basins for oath taking. Wolves circle the outer lanes at dusk.</li>
      <li><strong>Toll Roads</strong> — Warrant gates stamp road writs. Curfew bells count patrols and hunts. Traders sleep inside the walls.</li>
      <li><strong>Shroud Docks</strong> — River quays under fog. Barges unload at noon and depart before dark. Lantern lines mark safe berths.</li>
      <li><strong>Border Posts</strong> — Gates toward the Crowns and Ashkarra. Inspectors seize garlic braids and illegal wards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Days start early and end with salt on doors. Names are kept short at night. Markets sell ash oil, warded lamps, and bread side by side. Funerals end with a plate under the tongue and a nail driven into the doorpost. Lanterns are salted at dusk and checked again at midnight.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Council of Barons</strong> sits at Greyspire. <strong>Baroness Serel</strong> claims the Greyhand legacy. <strong>Baron Vorath Bloodbane</strong> holds the levy lists and the right to sentence. <strong>Baroness Ysera Wolfthorn</strong> commands the hunts. The <strong>Black Lyceum</strong> binds revenants and advises in law of blood. Vyranithar’s houses, led by <strong>Varros Lysarin</strong> and <strong>Isolde Veyth</strong>, write marriages and compacts that cross the river and the night.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>162 AE</strong> — Greyspire founded by Ilyra Greyhand. The Lyceum of Oaths teaches law spells.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — Three day eclipse. Plague and curse spread. The Sword of Umberlight breaks on the court stone.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Greythrone fractures. Night Baronies rise. The Lyceum of Oaths is corrupted into the Black Lyceum.</li>
      <li><strong>Sixth Century AE</strong> — The baronies entrench. Vyranithar’s influence grows, and river messengers move by night.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Curfew bells set the rhythm. Revenant patrols keep the roads empty after dark. The council hears blood suits at noon and closes at dusk. Shroud Docks load by lamp. Outsiders keep tutors who can read a keep’s bells before they read a treaty.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Baroness Serel</strong> — Chair of the council. Claims Greyhand right and keeps the court lamps burning.</li>
      <li><strong>Baron Vorath Bloodbane</strong> — Levy master and judge. His writ is heavy and rarely lifted.</li>
      <li><strong>Baroness Ysera Wolfthorn</strong> — Leads the moor hunts. Her riders run with wolves.</li>
      <li><strong>The Black Lyceum</strong> — Necromancers who bind revenants with bone slips and iron plates.</li>
      <li><strong>Varros Lysarin and Isolde Veyth</strong> — Vyranithar’s hands in Greyspire. Contracts arrive in black wax.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Blood oaths</strong> are taken at iron basins. A sworn drop turns black if true. Breaking the oath leaves a mark on the palm that never fades.</p>
        <p><strong>Revenant plates</strong> are bone slips etched with a name and set under the tongue. A revenant serves until the plate is cracked on the court stone.</p>
        <p><strong>Curfew bells</strong> sound three for patrol, five for hunt, seven for levy press. Doors close on seven without question.</p>
        <p><strong>Lantern salt</strong> is pinched into the flame at dusk. A quiet flame is safe. A hiss means move indoors.</p>
        <p><strong>Road writs</strong> carry keep stamp, date, and quarter moon. Traders hide them in belts and boot heels.</p>

      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>The Blind Wastes</strong> were once the Singing Dunes, a fertile desert crossed by caravans. In the War of Shattered Skies, celestial fire fused the dunes into glass and demonic storms poisoned the rivers. The land became a field of black panes, jagged spires, and salt-crusted riverbeds. Today, the Wastes stretch between Salt’s Rest and the Tharuk Courts. Caravans risk its edges, Skathra raiders strike from its hollows, and relic hunters search its ruins.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Singing Panes</strong> — Flat stretches of fused glass that hum in the wind. Caravans avoid them because sound carries for miles.</li>
      <li><strong>Black Spire Line</strong> — Burnt towers left from the War of Shattered Skies. Skathra crucify captives here as warnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Dead Rivers</strong> — Dry riverbeds lined with salt. Some hide collapsed settlements beneath layers of glass.</li>
      <li><strong>The Mirage</strong> — A phantom city seen on the horizon. Travelers report towers lit as if whole. Those who walk toward it are rarely seen again.</li>
      <li><strong>Khelra’s Threshold</strong> — Cave mouths in the southern escarpment. Here <strong>Matron Khelra</strong> of the Tharuk Courts bargains with mortals, trading protection for oaths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>The <strong>Skathra</strong> tribes live by raiding caravans and scavenging relics. Their shamans cast bone lots on glass panes to choose routes. The <strong>Sandborn</strong> delvers search for ruin metal and lost machines, selling what they recover in Salt’s Rest. Caravans light blue salt fires at night, believed to keep storm spirits and raiders at bay. Life in the Wastes is short, violent, and tied to scavenging what the old desert left behind.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No kingdom rules the Wastes. Skathra tribes control different regions by strength and season. The <strong>Tharuk Courts</strong> maintain hidden halls beneath the desert, where <strong>Matron Khelra</strong> and her servants strike bargains with desperate mortals. Salt’s Rest Syndicates employ guides and guards to cross the margins, but their influence ends at the first spire.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Late Old Era</strong> — The Singing Dunes thrive with rivers and caravan routes.</li>
      <li><strong>War of Shattered Skies</strong> — Celestial fire and demonic storms destroy the Dunes. The land becomes the Blind Wastes.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — Survivors join Lady Veyra’s march east to Salt’s Rest. Others take refuge in caverns and swear to Matron Khelra.</li>
      <li><strong>First Age</strong> — Skathra tribes form, crucifying caravaners on spires. The Wastes gain their reputation as a deathland.</li>
      <li><strong>Third–Fourth Centuries AE</strong> — Crown caravans divert south. Salt’s Rest rises as the main crossing point.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Skathra raids continue. Black ice veins appear in the deep dunes, and caravans speak of whole cities preserved beneath glass.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>The Blind Wastes remain hostile and unstable. Caravans stick to the edge, hiring Skathra guides or heavily armed guards. Raiders attack from glass hollows and vanish again into the desert. The Tharuk Courts expand their influence through pacts, and Salt’s Rest grows rich supplying water and protection. Travelers still speak of the Mirage, and delvers return with shards of glass that hum like struck bells.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Matron Khelra the Red-Eyed</strong> — Tharuk noble who bargains with mortals at the Threshold caves.</li>
      <li><strong>The Bonegrinders, Rustcloaks, and Glassborn</strong> — Skathra tribes who raid caravans and rule portions of the desert.</li>
      <li><strong>The Sandborn</strong> — Relic hunters who map routes across the panes and sell recovered ruin metal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Singing glass</strong> hums in the wind. Raiders use the sound to track prey, while caravans use it as a warning to avoid certain routes.</p>
        <p><strong>Salt fires</strong> burn low and blue. Traders light them around camps at night to ward off storm voices.</p>
        <p><strong>Bone lots</strong> are cast by Skathra shamans. Cracks in the glass beneath the bones are read as signs of where to raid or flee.</p>
        <p><strong>Ruin metal</strong> scavenged from the Wastes is valuable but dangerous. Some blades are said to cut their wielder without being drawn.</p>
        <p><strong>The Mirage</strong> appears as a perfect city under glass, sometimes seen at dusk. Caravans avoid it, and Sandborn delvers leave offerings before turning back. Its cause remains unknown.</p>

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>Rumia</strong> is a web of gentle valleys where rivers braid through fields and orchards. It was never founded by decree. Villages grew where soil was kind and fish were plenty. People here keep to planting days, river runs, and shared barns. Magic is small and trusted. A charm stitched into a shawl. A blessing over seed. The <strong>Loom of Seasons</strong>, an Arcanum hall woven into living trees, teaches hearth work and weather craft rather than war.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Standing Loom</strong> — A communal weaving hall. Each household adds a thread to the yearly tapestry. Patterns record births, floods, and good harvests.</li>
      <li><strong>Greenbridge</strong> — An old mossed bridge that never frosts in winter. Travelers leave flowers in its cracks and a coin for safe crossings.</li>
      <li><strong>Winterhearths</strong> — Shared barns of grain and wood. Keys are kept by three elders so no one starves or freezes.</li>
      <li><strong>River Steps</strong> — Stone stairs where boats beach and nets are mended. Fish is smoked with applewood and traded upriver.</li>
      <li><strong>Orchard Rows</strong> — Terraced slopes of apple and plum. Children hang ribbon charms to keep blight away.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Days follow the bell and the sun. Spring brings planting songs. Midsummer brings dances on the green. Autumn is the great pressing of apples. Midwinter fills halls with stories and stew. Tapestries and memory keep the record more than ledgers do. Guests are given bread, salt, and a place by the stove. Disputes end with a shared loaf torn in thirds for the two parties and the hearth spirit.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No lords rule Rumia. Elders call councils beneath ash and oak. The <strong>Loom Wardens</strong> keep the weaving hall and teach charms that ward barns and cribs. The <strong>Loom of Seasons</strong>, a branch of the Arcanum, stands at the edge of a grove. Apprentices learn weather working by walking the fields and speaking to river stones. Fae borders are treated with courtesy, and oaths are spoken at dawn when shadows are short.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Always</strong> — Valleys settled wherever soil, fish, and water were kind. No single founding day is remembered.</li>
      <li><strong>283 AE</strong> — Crowned Kingdom chroniclers note a land of stubborn simplicity where villages share barns and stories.</li>
      <li><strong>Third–Fourth Centuries AE</strong> — Wars pass elsewhere. Armies march around the valleys and find nothing to claim.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — <strong>Brother Kaleth</strong> raises Obsidian Steles along the roads. Rumians fold stele blessings into their seasonal rites.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — The yearly tapestry carries a thin black thread to mark the far creep of the ice. Planting, fishing, and weaving continue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Rumia keeps its rhythm. Nets go out at dawn, spindles turn at dusk, stoves burn through the night. The Loom of Seasons opens its doors to travelers who bring a story and help mend a fence. Fae laughter is sometimes heard at midsummer on the green. The black thread in the tapestry grows by a finger’s length each year, and elders measure it with a plain stick.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Edrin Weavecaller</strong> — Archmage of the Loom who stitched weather charms into cloth so a field could drink rain on a dry week.</li>
      <li><strong>Lira Harrowfield</strong> — Crop singer whose songs kept grain standing through two hard storms.</li>
      <li><strong>Brother Kaleth of the Road</strong> — Wanderer who raised the Obsidian Steles and taught a blessing to pair with each stone.</li>
      <li><strong>The Loom Wardens</strong> — Keepers of the weaving hall who teach knot charms and keep the key to the Winterhearths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Season rites</strong> begin with a bowl of clean water placed by the door at dawn. A pinch of flour is sprinkled over it before the first loaf is cut.</p>
        <p><strong>Weaving magic</strong> uses thread dyed with herb steeps. Blue thread is for rain calls. Red is for warding sickness from calves and cribs. Green is for luck in the orchard.</p>
        <p><strong>Bridge courtesy</strong> at Greenbridge asks each crosser to put a flower in the stone and touch the water with two fingers for safe return.</p>
        <p><strong>Stele blessings</strong> pair each road stone with a short verse. Travelers speak the verse and leave a scrap of ribbon so the road remembers their name.</p>
        <p><strong>Fae manners</strong> forbid iron tools past certain trees on festival days. Guests who forget are offered a wooden knife and a smile so no offense is taken.</p>
        <p><strong>Black thread</strong> in the yearly tapestry marks the Ruin’s slow approach. Children are taught to measure its length each spring and record the fingers in chalk on the loom post.</p>

    <div class="top">
      <div class="lead">
        <p><strong>The Sable Fens</strong> are the Crowned Kingdoms’ penal swamps. Black ichor seeps up through peat beds and is boiled in stilted towers to make fuel for furnaces and sky docks. Convicts work the pumps and stills in shackled crews. Fires start without warning. Smoke carries a bitter taste that clings to hair and rope. The Crowns depend on Fen fuel, and so the barges come with each season, bringing new labor and taking away drums with skull marks burned into the hoops.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Stiltrun</strong> — Walkways on piles over black water. Shacks, barracks, and a bell that rings for shift, spill, and fire.</li>
      <li><strong>Pikehouse Yard</strong> — The Wardens’ headquarters. Sentence ledgers, brand irons, and the cage where appeals are heard at noon only.</li>
      <li><strong>Firereach Towers</strong> — Boiling stacks that turn raw ichor into drum fuel. Each tower has a spill trench and a burned scar around the base.</li>
      <li><strong>Leechwater Cut</strong> — A dredged channel for convict barges. Nets hang from the sides to catch bodies during flood fire.</li>
      <li><strong>Drum Quay</strong> — Loading slips for marked barrels. Tally clerks chalk weights while coopers seal hoops with pitch.</li>
      <li><strong>Ash Flats</strong> — Black sand bars where fires burned themselves out. Wardens test new spill walls here and bury the nameless.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Fens life runs by the spill bell. Crews wake before dawn and eat standing. Work songs keep time on the pumps. Every shift ends with a count in the Pikehouse yard. Convicts tie charm-strings to railings and spare a sip to the marsh. Chaplains walk the catwalks with water and salt and a short prayer for those the barrels have already taken. Letters home smell of tar even after washing.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>The Fens are ruled by the <strong>Fen Wardens</strong> under commission from the House of Voices. <strong>Warden-Marshal Corven Pike</strong> sets quotas and sentences. <strong>Drum Clerk Salra Venn</strong> tallies loads and signs the release slips that turn years into months. The Crowns send auditors each spring, but the Wardens hold the keys and the brands. Bargemen and cartel agents do steady business in the Drum Quay shadows where coin can shorten a shift or lengthen a sentence.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — Black ice scars the world. Ichor beds are mapped as a strategic reserve. Small stills are raised on piles.</li>
      <li><strong>251 AE</strong> — The House of Voices charters the Fens as penal colonies. Distillation expands to feed Crown furnaces.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — The Northern Reach is swallowed by the Ruin. Fen production doubles to replace lost fuel. Flood fires kill hundreds.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Skyship cores rely on Fen fuel. Accidents rise. Wardens add spill bells and overflow cuts to every tower.</li>
      <li><strong>Sixth Century AE</strong> — Cartel influence grows. Bribery turns sentences. New towers go up beyond the Ash Flats.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — The Crowns cannot do without the Fens. Barges arrive with chains and leave with drums that keep foundries and sky docks alive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Smoke lies low at dawn. The bell rings, pumps thump, and steam climbs. Wardens count heads and check brands. Convicts watch the wind and keep a hand on the spill rope. Barges nose into Drum Quay by the hour. When a tower flares, all sound vanishes for a heartbeat, then the Fens scream and the fire runs across the water like oil on glass.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Warden-Marshal Corven Pike</strong> — Commands the Fen Wardens. Known for a calm voice and a ledger without gaps.</li>
      <li><strong>Drum Clerk Salra Venn</strong> — Holds the seal that releases early workers. Rumor says her chalk can add years as easily as it removes months.</li>
      <li><strong>Chaplain Ise Low</strong> — Walks the catwalks with water and salt. Keeps the names of the dead when no one else will.</li>
      <li><strong>The Chain Gangs</strong> — Rotating convict crews. Known by the color of their sleeve rags and the songs they use to time the pumps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Spill bells</strong> ring three times for a breach and seven for a tower fire. On the seventh ring everyone drops lines and runs the catwalks to the ash ladders.</p>
        <p><strong>Drum marks</strong> are burned into barrel hoops. A skull for high grade fuel. A crescent for creosote. Two slashes for reject drums that will be reboiled at risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Sentence boards</strong> list names and tallies by dawn light. A black nail beside a name means the worker is owed a day off. A red nail means a fight or a theft and the next shift on spill watch.</p>
        <p><strong>Charm-strings</strong> hang from railings and helmet straps. Bits of glass, bone, and twine tied with a marsh reed. Nobody removes another person’s string. Even Wardens step around them.</p>
        <p><strong>Flood fire</strong> happens when wind and tide pull burning fuel under the walkways. Veterans smell it before the first orange shows and start to run. New workers learn by watching who bolts first.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Skathra survives by turning ruin into use. Nothing is waste if it can be turned or burned.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Clans vote with parts on the table. The heaviest pile wins the day.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Children learn to climb before they read. The best traders never carry coin home.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Salvage, refit, and rig building. Crystal shards power lamps when oil runs thin.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Sparks are counted as omens. Three blue in a row means stop the work.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Half the city is an underworld. The other half is just better lit.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Buys water from Salt’s Rest. Sells parts to everyone. Pays Tharuk on time and never names it tribute.</p>

          <li><em>Bone Market</em> Prices change when the wind does. Traders listen to flags as much as they listen to buyers.</li>
          <li><em>Rig Yards</em> A good patch is worth more than a new build. New breaks fast.</li>

        <p><strong>Notables</strong> <em>Rhess Coil</em> keeps a tower with more wire than walls. <em>Jaro Flint</em> never barters twice with the same weight. <em>Phem</em> can wake a dead lamp with a finger and a curse.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Sable Fens turns bodies into fuel. Peat is cut, boiled to flux, and sealed in drums marked with the Crown. The work never ends, the marsh never forgives, and the smoke carries to villages that pretend not to smell it.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Overseer Brack Ilen rules by gauge and lash. Factors handle contracts; marsh guards enforce quotas. Appeals go to Veythmir and return months later, usually with more numbers and fewer words.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Free workers wear oilskin hoods and look down when counting chains. Sentenced labor sleep to the bell and wake to the bell. Favors are a parallel currency; a dry pair of boots is worth a week’s pay.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Flux, tar, and timber. Anything else is contraband and moves at night across the planks.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> The Chaplain of Burden marks each new arrival with ash and a shackle, “so office carries its own cost.” Prayers are short; the marsh eats the long ones.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> Smugglers skim drums and top them with swamp water. Guards take a cut. When Veythmir audits, bodies wash up in the reeds.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> The House of Voices denies the Fens are a prison and calls them “labor colonies.” Ashkarra captains sell protection then look away. The Baronies buy flux with velvet and silence.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong> Tharuk is less a city than a calculus. Everything has weight and price. The Court speaks rarely, but its balances are exact, and the Wastes move when its sums do.</p>
        <p><strong>Government</strong> Arch Daimon Kharithul presides; Auditors keep the Lines; Brokers translate intent into terms that bind. Punishments are adjustments, not spectacles.</p>
        <p><strong>Culture and class</strong> Speech is measured, favors itemized, silence prized. Surface envoys are treated as ledgers with legs.</p>
        <p><strong>Industry</strong> Tribute management, deep-heat craft, and services the surface pretends not to buy.</p>
        <p><strong>Faith and rite</strong> Oaths are sealed by heat on obsidian. There are shrines, but the Court claims the right to count them.</p>
        <p><strong>Underworld</strong> There is no underworld here—only unauthorized accounts. They are closed quickly.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations</strong> Skathra trades parts in exchange for quiet shipments. Salt’s Rest pays to be left alone. The Crowns deny knowing the route in; Ashkarra sells maps that are mostly wrong.</p>

        <p><strong>The Seven Crowns War</strong> tore through the heartlands in the late Third Century AE.

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aurora Spire</strong> — Crystal halls where light refracts in shifting bands. The Prism Archive works here.</li>
      <li><strong>Prism Vaults</strong> — Stacks of thin crystal plates etched with star paths, storm bands, and warning lines.</li>
      <li><strong>Sealstone Steps</strong> — Terraced landings cut into black rock. Boats beach and nets dry on bone racks.</li>
      <li><strong>Icebreaker Sound</strong> — A channel that stays open in deep winter. Harpoons are blessed at its mouth.</li>
      <li><strong>Starfall Ridge</strong> — A slate ridge pocked with old impacts. Children collect iron stones that point north.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Homes keep two fires. One cooks. One feeds the dead. Guests who share a pot are kin until sunrise. Hunters play rib flutes for the fallen before setting a share on the ice. Names are spoken carefully under bright lights. People sleep in short watches and read weather in the sound of snow on the roof.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Clan chiefs meet to set quotas, mark safe ice, and judge disputes. The Spire keeps its own law. The <strong>Prism Wardens</strong> maintain charts, teach navigation, and tend wards that watch for Tharuk signs. When cases cross clan and Spire lines, chiefs and Wardens speak together and enter the ruling in both ledgers.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Primordial</strong> — The Spire stands before written years. First keepers are remembered as Wardens Before Names.</li>
      <li><strong>Late Old Era</strong> — War of Shattered Skies scars the north. Lights shift in fixed bands after storms.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — The Black Ruin begins its slow advance far to the north. Ice walls are first recorded.</li>
      <li><strong>73 AE</strong> — <strong>Selune Kael</strong> retakes the Spire. The Prism Archive is restored.</li>
      <li><strong>473 AE</strong> — <strong>Captain Drevan Coldmark</strong> vanishes in ice fog after plotting a new line off the charts.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Black ice veins appear beneath the pack. The Archive notes a slow creep each generation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Boats work the ice edge by day and mend nets by night. Wardens listen for faults in the plates and tune ward lines as bands drift. Traders from the south buy oil and bone craft and bring iron and salt. Everyone watches the dark veining under the pack and listens when the lights crackle like breath on glass.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Archwarden Selune Kael</strong> — Restored the Spire in 73 AE and set the Archive to work.</li>
      <li><strong>Ulfric Skarn</strong> — Clan chief known for winter hunts beyond Icebreaker Sound.</li>
      <li><strong>Kaelra Skarn</strong> — Sea pilot who marked safe routes along Starfall Ridge.</li>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Red Gallery</strong> — Scribes draft pacts with ash and blood. A contract that does not kindle at sealing is void and punished.</li>
      <li><strong>Chainsmoke Hall</strong> — Oaths are hung on iron links. The smoke tastes bitter to mortals and sweet to demons.</li>
      <li><strong>Oathfire Pits</strong> — Flames rise when a true pact is made. Breaking a pact brands the name into the breaker’s memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Brazen Docks</strong> — Black lakes hold galleys that row without wind. Hulls carry prisoners and tribute to deeper courts.</li>
      <li><strong>Maw Throne</strong> — Lord Veykar’s seat of judgment. Captains and ministers kneel here before taking the field.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Place is held by contract. Rank is measured by whose seal you bear. Food is ash bread and bloodwine. Training pits echo with steel. Thralls scrub soot from pillars and polish chains. Ministers teach letters before they teach fear.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p><strong>Lord Veykar the Ashen Horn</strong> presides in the present age. <strong>Minister Sathriel</strong> keeps ledgers of pacts. <strong>Matron Khelra</strong> runs mortal cults and courts bargains on the surface. <strong>Captain Vornek Iron Fang</strong> leads raids. Older songs remember <strong>Prince Zaruth the Maw</strong>, whose rule ended when Veykar rose in the deep.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — Mortal refugees bargain for protection. Khelra reveals herself to the desperate.</li>
      <li><strong>First–Second Centuries AE</strong> — The Courts consolidate under Zaruth. Contracts are codified and ranked by seal.</li>
      <li><strong>290s AE</strong> — Veykar overthrows Zaruth and claims the Maw Throne. Captains swear new oaths.</li>
      <li><strong>Fourth Century AE</strong> — Vornek Iron Fang raids the surface. Mortal towns vanish into the dark.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Sathriel’s records bind whole lineages. Breaking a pact brings curses that pass to heirs.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Veykar rules. Khelra still walks. Contracts reach into mortal halls and markets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Firelight paints the pillars. Seals are pressed. Names are spoken. In the Courts, a word written is a link forged, and every link pulls something closer to the dark.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Lord Veykar the Ashen Horn</strong> — Prince of the Courts in the present age. His judgments are brief and final.</li>
      <li><strong>Minister Sathriel</strong> — Keeper of the Thousand Seals. No pact escapes his ledgers.</li>
      <li><strong>Matron Khelra the Red Eyed</strong> — Emissary to mortals. Smiles when others pray.</li>
      <li><strong>Captain Vornek Iron Fang</strong> — Raider and war lord. Chains speak louder than banners in his ranks.</li>
      <li><strong>Prince Zaruth the Maw</strong> — Former ruler. His laws still shape infernal order.</li>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Brazen Gate</strong> — Eastern entry to the path, crowned with iron braziers. All who seek the Conclave begin here, swearing the road’s oath before the keepers.</li>
      <li><strong>Emberwalk Terrace</strong> — A stair cut into the mountainside. Pilgrims descend at midsummer, carrying brands said to mirror the Ancients’ first steps into the deep.</li>
      <li><strong>Ash Vaults</strong> — Caves carved as reliquaries. Failed brands, broken weapons, and oath scrolls are kept here in black urns.</li>
      <li><strong>Pilgrim Rows</strong> — Inns and shrines strung along the climb. Their walls bear tapestries of every Emberwalk, dyed in ash and ember pigments.</li>
      <li><strong>Summit Hall</strong> — Stone ring at the end of the path. The Conclave of Dragons convenes here, with the Horned Table at its center. Only those who walk the Emberpath may enter.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life on the Emberpath is a cycle of trial and service. Keepers tend braziers in shifts, never letting flame fail. Caravans march with bells and banners, knowing wolves and worse stalk the ridges. Every year, the Emberwalk draws pilgrims, soldiers, and supplicants. For commoners it is prayer. For nobles it is proof. For all, it is the fire-road to legitimacy at the Conclave.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No crown rules the Emberpath. <strong>Wardens of Kaelthwyn</strong> keep its wayhouses and shrines, answerable only to the Conclave above. The <strong>Horned Table</strong> at Summit Hall is where dragons once sat with mortals to judge pacts and wars. Though no Ancient has appeared in centuries, the Emberpath still holds force. No pact sworn at the Horned Table counts unless the emissary has walked the path.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — Survivors of the Black Ruin are guided through the Emberpath by dragonkin. The first oathfires are lit in the shrines.</li>
      <li><strong>73 AE</strong> — Aurora Spire retaken. Pilgrims march from Spire to Emberpath to give thanks and keep vigil in the terraces.</li>
      <li><strong>108 AE</strong> — Pact of the Horned Table. The Emberwalk is formalized as rite of legitimacy. Every ruler, priest, and envoy must walk the path to speak at the Conclave.</li>
      <li><strong>312 AE</strong> — Arcteryax the Bronze Blue descends at the Horned Table, blessing warriors with sparks. Last sighting of an Ancient Dragon in living memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — Brother Kaleth raises <strong>Obsidian Steles</strong> along the path. Names of the fallen are carved and remembered at each Emberwalk.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — High Warden Serath Kaelwyn commands the keepers. Braziers burn without pause. The Horned Table convenes, though dragons no longer answer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>The Emberpath burns steady. At dusk, fires flare from Brazen Gate to Summit Hall. Caravans climb under banners, and pilgrims march with brands. The Conclave still hears voices, though the seats for dragons sit empty. To walk the Emberpath remains the rite by which rulers and emissaries prove themselves before the world.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Arcteryax the Bronze Blue</strong> — Ancient Dragon who blessed the Horned Table in 312 AE, last of his kind seen on the path.</li>
      <li><strong>Brother Kaleth of the Road</strong> — Monk pilgrim who raised the Obsidian Steles to honor the dead.</li>
      <li><strong>Marros Ironhand</strong> — Dragonkin chieftain guided by Arcteryax, remembered for signing the Pact of the Horned Table.</li>
      <li><strong>High Warden Serath Kaelwyn</strong> — Current warden of the Emberpath, keeper of braziers, and arbiter of the road’s oaths.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>The Emberwalk</strong> is the rite of proof. Pilgrims and emissaries carry brands the length of the path, their ash scattered at Summit Hall. A brand that fails before the end marks the walker unworthy.</p>
        <p><strong>Obsidian Steles</strong> rise at intervals, black stone marked with names of the lost. Some say the stones hum faintly during Emberwalk nights.</p>
        <p><strong>Oath braziers</strong> are lit at shrines along the climb. Each flame represents a pact sworn at the Conclave. Extinguishing one is treason against the Horned Table.</p>
        <p><strong>Dragon marks</strong> are carvings of talons and wings on High Spans. Keepers say the Ancients pressed them into the rock themselves before vanishing.</p>
        <p><strong>Legends</strong> claim that if dragons return, the Emberpath will blaze on its own, every brazier from Gate to Summit burning brighter than day.</p>

        <p><strong>Elessus</strong> is the heart of <strong>Alithanthia</strong>, built on river terraces and bound to the fae Courts. Founded by <strong>King Hareth I the Binder of Groves</strong> in 1870 BE, the city has never stood by steel alone. Dawn and Twilight fae walk its groves, binding oaths to trees, stones, and waters. Lanterns glow without flame. Bridges grow from roots. Every treaty is written in song as much as in ink, for the fae turn cold when mortals trust parchment more than promise.</p>

    <hr class="sep">

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Palace of Groves</strong> — White stone halls grown around sacred trees. Oaths are spoken in the throne grove, bound in bark and blossom.</li>
      <li><strong>River Market</strong> — Barges bring silk, fruit, and spices. Fae trinkets glow on stalls, traded for coin, song, or memory.</li>
      <li><strong>Rootbridge Quarter</strong> — Bridges of living wood span the waters. Families weave offerings into their roots each new moon.</li>
      <li><strong>Twilight Garden</strong> — A shaded enclave where the Court of Twilight once walked. Lanterns glow with cold flame. Mortals still leave wine and honey there.</li>
      <li><strong>Courtstone Circle</strong> — Stones where the Dawn Court appears at midsummer. Petitions are sung, not spoken, and bargains are sealed with touch of hand to stone.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life in Elessus is shaped by oaths. Children learn early that words carry weight, for broken promises sour milk and blight crops. Festivals follow the fae seasons: <strong>Dawn’s Bloom</strong> in spring, <strong>Summer’s Dance</strong>, <strong>Autumn’s Tithe</strong>, and <strong>Winter’s Watch</strong>. Songs carry law as much as courts do. Written ledgers are kept, but bargains of note are sung in chorus so that the fae hear and hold them true.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Elessus is ruled from the <strong>Palace of Groves</strong>. Kings and queens sit beside envoys of the fae. The <strong>Court of Dawn</strong> grants favor when oaths are honored. The <strong>Court of Twilight</strong> grants power in shadows, but its favors often come with hidden cost. The Council of Groves advises the throne, half mortal lords, half fae envoys. No crown decree stands unless bound to stone or tree in ritual.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1870 BE</strong> — King Hareth I founds Elessus, binding Alithanthia to the Court of Dawn.</li>
      <li><strong>Later BE</strong> — Queen Esra I allies with the Court of Twilight, balancing light and shadow.</li>
      <li><strong>Pre 0 AE</strong> — King Jorath II offends the fae with written contracts. Several groves go silent. Famines follow.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — The Black Ruin strikes Cindralith. Elessus survives untouched, its groves shielding the city.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong> — Eclipse. While Greythrone falls, Elessus holds fast to its oaths. The Courts of Dawn and Twilight both appear in the groves to mark the balance.</li>
      <li><strong>Sixth Century AE</strong> — Elessus remains bound by fae law. No army marches from its gates without ritual leave.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Elessus prospers, its terraces green and its markets full. Yet whispers tell that the Courts grow restless. Dawn fades when merchants break oaths for coin, and Twilight sharpens when nobles bargain for power. Still, no city in the Crowns is more watched, for where Elessus leans, Alithanthia follows.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>King Hareth I the Binder of Groves</strong> — Founder who tied the throne to the Court of Dawn.</li>
      <li><strong>Queen Esra I</strong> — Allied with the Court of Twilight, remembered as the Queen of Two Lights.</li>
      <li><strong>King Jorath II</strong> — Offended the fae with written contracts, bringing blight on the land.</li>
      <li><strong>The Court of Dawn</strong> — Appears at midsummer, favoring oaths of growth and balance.</li>
      <li><strong>The Court of Twilight</strong> — Appears in autumn and winter, granting shadowy favors at high cost.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Oathbinding</strong> is the law of Elessus. To break a sworn promise is to invite fae spite. Offenders find their wells dry, their hearths cold, or their children sickly until amends are made.</p>
        <p><strong>Root offerings</strong> are woven into bridges each new moon. Threads, flowers, or coins please the living wood and the fae who shaped it.</p>
        <p><strong>Dawn favors</strong> glow gold. Fields planted after a Dawn Court bargain yield double. Yet crops wither if the song is not sung again the following year.</p>
        <p><strong>Twilight favors</strong> glow blue. They grant cunning, beauty, or hidden strength. But they draw a shadow that lengthens over years, ending in debt to the Court.</p>
        <p><strong>Silent Groves</strong> are places where fae no longer answer. Mortals still leave gifts, hoping silence breaks, but the trees stay dark and the air heavy.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Glassfang</strong> — A jagged tower of fused sand, cutting flesh on touch. Said to mark where the Mirage lingered before the Skathra settled. Gangs etch their marks into its walls as claims of dominance.</li>
      <li><strong>Thornfield</strong> — A plain of black glass shards where crucifixions are raised. Every gang enforces law here by blood and spectacle.</li>
      <li><strong>The Charred Bazaar</strong> — A smoke-choked market of salvage and ichor stills. Engines, bones, and relic metal are traded for blood-coin or veinstone dust.</li>
      <li><strong>Ossuary Streets</strong> — Alleyways where walls are mortared with skulls and ribs. Families hang offerings of cloth or blood to honor ancestors and claim their protection.</li>
      <li><strong>The Fume Warrens</strong> — A labyrinth of collapsed salvage halls and veinstone dens. Black smoke stains every wall. Addicts mutter prophecies while gangs carve debts into their skin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Life in Skathra is ruled by gangs and blood debts. Every family belongs to a clan. Oaths are cut in blood and sealed in sand. To betray an oath is to be crucified. Food comes from raided caravans, ichor stills, or desperate trade. Children grow up picking through wreckage, learning to scavenge steel from glass. Nights are loud with drums, screams, and debt-marking rituals. To outsiders Skathra is ruin. To its people, it is the only freedom left.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>No crown sits in Skathra. Power belongs to whoever can hold it. The <strong>Shardmothers</strong> oversee crucifixions and blood-oaths. The <strong>Chainbreaker clans</strong> lead raids across the Wastes. The <strong>Glassborn</strong>, said to carry light of the Mirage in their eyes, hold eerie sway over the people. Alliances shift, but oaths once sworn in blood are eternal.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong> — The Black Ruin turns the Singing Dunes to glass. Survivors scatter as wandering clans, later called Mirage and Skathra.</li>
      <li><strong>First Age</strong> — Skathra raiders crucify caravaners on glass shards. Their name becomes feared from Salt’s Rest to the Mawrange.</li>
      <li><strong>Later</strong> — The Mirage people continue to wander. The Skathra choose to stay, building their settlement around the Glassfang.</li>
      <li><strong>Fifth Century AE</strong> — The Shardmothers rise. Crucifixions become ritual spectacle. Korrin Chainbreaker leads raids as far as Ashkarra’s coasts.</li>
      <li><strong>Present</strong> — Skathra endures as a city of gangs and oaths. Caravans skirt its smoke but still risk its Charred Bazaar for salvage and ichor fuel.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Today, Skathra is a city of blood and fire. Its glass walls shimmer with the memory of the Mirage. Crucifix drums echo across the Wastes. The Fume Warrens choke with veinstone smoke. Caravans fear it, yet cannot ignore its markets. The Mirage people still roam, but Skathra has rooted itself in ruin, thriving on cruelty and survival.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Shardmothers</strong> are matriarchs who keep the crucifix rites and hold more fear than any gang leader.</li>
      <li><strong>Korrin Chainbreaker</strong> a raider chief who carved a legend in fire and chains, still invoked in gang chants.</li>
      <li><strong>The Glassborn</strong>  A bloodline said to shine with the Mirage’s light, their eyes reflecting glass-fire in darkness.</li>
      <li><strong>Blood-Singer clans</strong> tend to be known for their ritual chants at crucifixions, said to make the glass itself tremble.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>

      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>Shared origin</strong>: The Mirage and Skathra were once the same people, wanderers after the Black Ruin destroyed their homes back in the first age. Whilst the Mirage still roam... the Skathra stopped, believing that growing fixed roots would be a strength.</p>
        <p><strong>Blood-oaths</strong>: All Skathran law rests on blood an eye for an eye is  bit of an understatement. Oaths are cut across palms, blood poured into sand bowls, then sealed tight in bone jars. To betray one is seen as blasphemy to some degree and perpetrators tend to be crucified in Thornfield.</p>
        <p><strong>Crucifixions</strong>: Both punishment and celebration. Gang debts, betrayals, and victories are marked by raising the guilty on glass shards, their names carved into the wall behind them.</p>
        <p><strong>The Glassfang</strong>: Said to still hum faintly at dusk, as if the Mirage itself left part of its soul in the tower. Some claim the Glassborn can hear it call.</p>
        <p><strong>Relations with the Mirage</strong>: When Skathra raiders cross paths with Mirage caravans, the encounters end in either blood feud or uneasy trade. They share the same songs of the First Age, though each claims the other betrayed their ancestors’ way.</p>

        <p><strong>Winterfast</strong> is a monastery stronghold built on storm-lashed islands east of the Northern Provinces. Founded before the Black Ruin, the monks of Winterfast chose isolation over mainland rule. They endured while the Northern Provinces rose in industry and fell to ice, preserving their discipline on the waves. Clad in plain robes and carrying curved steel, the Winterfast Orders live by silence, oath, and ritual. To outsiders they are both sanctuary and threat, for every monk is a scholar and every scholar a warrior.</p>

    <h3>Districts & Landmarks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>The Central halls of resonance</strong> is the heart of the monastery and a single ring of the bronze bells outside mark each hour of silence and prayer. The central hall stands at the center of settlement in question and, its wood roof is traditionally carved with waves and storms, a testament to their surroundings and their resillience. What you embrace in turn shall embrace you.</li>
      <li><strong> The Straight of Stillness</strong> is essentially a long timber pier reinforced with iron, that is lashed by waves year-round. Travellers from other regions disembark here, greeted not with words but with bowed heads and ritual silence. The Stright is also used by those devotees who wish to still themselves amidst the chaos of surroundings, standing unflinching on its end.</li>
      <li><strong>Garden of Falling Snow</strong>  A walled grove of pine and snow-bloom where monks meditate on impermanence, it also acts as a mediation point and continuing disputes here are settled with either brush or blade, never raised voices.</li>
      <li><strong>Walk of Enduring</strong> are primrarily stone corridors carved into cliff walls, lit by lanterns and lit by a flame placed along with a a vow once sworn. If a lantern darkens, the vow is in most cases deemed as broken, and the speaker of said vow must  endure Liantry, a penance of questioning, inner work and fasting.</li>
      <li><strong>The Vigil Line</strong> Built before the count of the first age the vigil line is a long curved sea wall shielding the harbor. Monestary devotees are often seen here during high seas or storms, robes snapping in the wind, enduring in silence as they move through various forms or kata.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Culture & Life</h3>
    <p>Winterfast life is measured by bells. Dawn for kata and weapon drills, noon for scripture, dusk for silence and the writing of oaths and occasionally setting vows. Devotees live in communal halls, with no material posessions, wearing plain robes with swords kept at their sides as both tool and trust. Outsiders are welcomed into the region, but monestaries are closed to them until they accept silence. Feast days are rare but marked with dances of blades, where monks display skill in forms passed down for centuries. The people believe storms are trials, and each weathering of one only makes them stronger.</p>

    <h3>Government & Power</h3>
    <p>Winterfast is ruled by the <strong>Grandmaster of the Hall of Resonance</strong>, chosen by consensus of senior masters. Beneath the Grandmaster, <strong>Orders</strong> divide by discipline. The Sword Order, the Lantern Order, the Ink Order. Authority flows from discipline, not blood. No outsider may command in Winterfast. Visitors may be sheltered, taught, or turned away, depending on how they hold to silence.</p>

    <h3>History</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Old Era</strong>: Monks establish cloisters on the islands, choosing seclusion over the mainland cities of the North.</li>
      <li><strong>Before 0 AE</strong>: The Northern Provinces rise in foundries and forges, mentions of the arcane whisper off travellers lips, however Winterfast remains apart, preserving the simpler way of steel and script.</li>
      <li><strong>0 AE</strong>: The Black Ruin swallows the Northern Provinces. Winterfast however endures, its islands untouched by large bodies of ice. Refugees arrive, some taken in as novices others turned away.</li>
      <li><strong>417 AE</strong>: The Eclipse darkens the sky. Winterfast bells toll for eleven days and nights as a colossal storm ravages the islands. The inhabitants that survived emerged stronger, claiming themselves those born of the storm.</li>
      <li><strong>473 AE</strong>: <strong>Captain Drevan Coldmark</strong> visits as a pilgrim before vanishing into the far north. His oaths are still read aloud on the Path of Enduring and his flame still sputters the Vow he once cast.</li>
      <li><strong>Sixth Century AE</strong>: Winterfast endures as guardian of the old ways. Its monks preserve fragments of Northern Province lore, but only those bound by vow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Now</h3>
    <p>Today, Winterfast is a place of both pilgrimage and fear. Pilgrims arrive to swear oaths or study in silence. Warriors come to test their blades against the monks. Rumors speak of manuscripts hidden in vaults that recall the Northern Provinces before their fall. To the monks of Winterfast, none of this matters. The bells still toll. The storms still come. Their vows remain unbroken.</p>

    <h3>Notable Figures</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Grandmaster Kaelen Frostmarked</strong> is the current Grandmaster, austere and silent, known for ending disputes with a single gesture.</li>
      <li><strong>Master Yorai</strong>, the Sword Order master, undefeated in kata duels, said to have cut snowflakes themselves cleanly in midair.</li>
      <li><strong>Scribe-Mother Elira</strong>the  Keeper of the Ink Order, who guards the written vows and the lore vaults they treasure.</li>
      <li><strong>Captain Drevan Coldrun</strong> travelled to Winterfast as  an explorer and pilgrim, after weeks with the people he set off in promise of his Vows.Those vows are still read  to this day despite his lost expedition, since the flame endures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Lore</h3>
    <details class="canon" open>
      <summary>Extended lore</summary>
      <div>
        <p><strong>The Three Orders</strong> divide Winterfast discipline...the Sword Order trains warriors... the Lantern Order tends vows and lanterns and the Ink Order preserves manuscripts and chronicles. Each child raised in the cloister asks the Masters to join at maturity.</p>
        <p><strong>Bell law</strong> is absolute. A bell rung means silence until the next toll. Outsiders who break silence risk exile from the islands.</p>
        <p><strong>Storm tithes</strong> are observed during blizzards... Monks line the Vigil Line in silence, until the chaos passes. To falter brings shame and to endure is honor.</p>
        <p><strong>The Path of Enduring</strong> carries the vows of centuries. If a lantern along the path goes dark, it means the vow was broken, and Liantry must be bestowed until their oath is repaid or their blood stains the stone.</p>
        <p><strong>The Scripted Halls</strong> is said to hold relics and manuscripts from the lost Northern Provinces, sealed with both ink and steel. Only the Ink Order or Senior Masters are granted entry.</p>
